programming topics (to do)\nChapter 6 - Advanced challenges in LÖVE (to do)\n\nWhat is this book?\nThis is a resource for building a programming foundation from scratch.\nIt teaches basic computer science and software building skills along the way, but more importantly, teaches you how to teach yourself and find out how to go about solving a problem or building a solution.\nTools come and go, so the goal is to teach things of value with less focus on the programming language or other tools you may be using to build what you want.\nI have been programming since 2007, focusing on teaching myself best practices. Along the way I have found a lot of good and bad tutorials on the right and wrong way to build things and I want to help others avoid getting stuck like I did.\nWho is this for?\n\nAny age group. Kids too, with a little help and encouragement!\nAnybody that wants to learn basic computer science. This book will touch on several computer science subjects in order to build programs.\nAnybody that wants to learn to program. No prior skills or knowledge required.\nAnybody that wants to learn to make a game. Making games are fun and require learning many things along the way. We'll build a few through this book.\nAnybody that wants to learn Lua. Although we won't dive into the advanced features of the language, we will gain a large understanding on how the language works in order to actually build some things. There are already online guides and references covering some of the more advanced topics. For experienced programmers wanting to learn Lua, the Programming in Lua book may be sufficient.\n\nAuthor and contributors\n\njaythomas: Original author\nJimmyStevens: Edits and suggestions in chapter 1 & 2\n\nContributing\n\nIssues, comments, and suggestions can be made using the GitHub issues page.\nTo download, build, and run the book or any code examples use the \"Clone or download\" button on the main repository page.\n\nFor developers and the curious\nFeel free to submit a pull request.\nThe documentation is built using NodeJS.\nIf you wish to run the documentation for local development purposes, install nodejs then run these commands from within the learn2love directory you downloaded:\nnpm install # Downloads build tools to the a \"node_modules\" folder inside the directory\nnpm start   # Creates a local web server to where you can visit the link http://localhost:4000\n\nOnce the local web server is running, any edits you make to the pages will rebuild the book and reload the page you're viewing.\n"},"pages/01-00-programming-basics.html":{"url":"pages/01-00-programming-basics.html","title":"1.0 - Programming basics","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Programming Basics\n"},"pages/01-01-interactive-coding.html":{"url":"pages/01-01-interactive-coding.html","title":"1.1 - Interactive coding","keywords":"","body":"Interactive coding\nWhat's a REPL?\nProgramming doesn't take much effort beyond loading up a REPL and just typing.\nWhat is a REPL?\nIt's an interactive window you can type code into and it spits out the results on screen when you hit enter.\nIt stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.\nThese are the 4 things the REPL does:\n\nRead the code that was just typed\nEvaluate, or process the code down into a result\nPrint, or spit out the result\nLoop... do everything again and again until the programmer is done\n\nIt's actually simpler than it sounds.\nLet's go to a website with a REPL and try it out: https://repl.it/languages/Lua\nYou will see two window panes on the website: a light side on the left and dark side on the right.\nThe right-side is the REPL and is what we're interested in for now.\nIt has a lot of information that isn't necessarily useful to us at the moment.\nSomething similar to this:\nLua 5.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2006 Lua.org, PUC-Rio\n[GCC 4.2.1 (LLVM, Emscripten 1.5)] on linux2\nThis is just telling you what programming language this REPL is loading, in this case, Lua.\nIf you click inside the window pane and start typing you will see your text appear.\nLet's try typing some code for the REPL to Read.\nYou already know some code if you know arithmetic.\nType:\n2 + 2\n\nThen hit ENTER and immediately the REPL will Print out:\n=> 4\nA lot happened very quickly.\nAfter hitting ENTER, the REPL, Read the line 2 + 2, it Evaluated the value of that statement to be 4, it Printed 4 on the screen for you, then Looped back to a new line to await your next command.\nTry out some more arithmetic.\nMultiplication:\n2 * 3\n\nSubtraction:\n2 + 2 - 4\n\nDivision:\n6 / 2\n\nYou can use parenthesis to tell it which order to do the operations:\n(2 + 2) * (3 + 1)\n\nWhich gives different results than:\n2 + 2 * 3 + 1\n\nIf you give the REPL a single number:\n12\n\nIt will give you back 12, because this can't be simplified down any further.\nYou can also do exponents using the ^ (caret) symbol:\n2^4\n\nNumbers are a type of data, and +, -, /, *, ^, % are operators.\nStatements such as 2 - 2 and 23 * 19 are all operations.\nOne last arithmetic operation we'll cover is modulo, which is done with the modulus operator.\nThe modulus operator is represented in most languages as a % (percent) symbol:\n8 % 3\n\nModulus operations aren't seen in grade school classrooms as often as the rest, but are quite common in software and computer sciences.\nThe way it works is you take the 2nd number and subtract it from the bigger number as many times as possible until the 1st number is bigger than the 2nd.\nThe result is what's left of the 1st number.\nWith 8 % 3, if you keep subtracting 3 from 8 then you end up with 2 left.\nA real world example is time elapsing on an analog clock.\nImagine the face of a clock with the hour hand on noon.\nIf 25 hours pass then the hour hand goes all the way around and ends on 1.\nThat would be the same as saying:\n25 % 12\n=> 1\n\nThe hour hand resets every time is passes 12, so 13 % 12, 25 % 12, and 37 % 12 would all equal 1.\nLikewise, 10 % 4 results in 2 because 4 goes into 10 twice, and leaves a remainder of 2.\nExercises\n\nTry typing different modulo operations in and guessing what the answer will be.\nTry using negative numbers (-3 + -2).\nTry using a set of parenthesis inside another set of parenthesis. Does it behave as you expect?\nAfter running through all the exercises press the 'up' key in the REPL. What happens and how can this speed up your work?\n\n"},"pages/01-02-strings.html":{"url":"pages/01-02-strings.html","title":"1.2 - Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumbers are one type of data that can be operated on.\nLet's explore another data type within the REPL.\nTake a set of quotes and put some text in it and hit ENTER:\n\"hello\"\n\nThe REPL will print hello back to you.\nThis is a string.\nA string is a set of characters (letters and symbols) stringed together as one single piece of data.\nThis string is made of 9 characters:\n\"H-E-L-L-O\"\n\nLike numbers, there are operators to make strings play with each other.\nThe concatenate operator (..) combines strings together:\n\"hello\" .. \"world\"\n\nWhat's the result?\nNotice that the resulting string has no space between the two words.\nIf you wanted a space, you would have to put one in the quotes to be part of the operation:\n\"hello \" .. \"world\"\n\nYou could even make a separate string with the space in it:\n\"hello\" .. \" \" .. \"world\"\n\nStrings can have any characters in them that you want.\n\"abc\" .. \"123\"\n\n\"Япо́нский\" .. \"ロシア語!!\"\n\nExercises\n\nTry using an arithmetic operator on strings \"hello\" / \"world\".

Try a few invalid variables names too just to see what the error message looks like. It's important to see error messages and understand them.

numbers and strings.\nThe number of data structures you can create are endless.\nWe need to learn about a few to not only understand how tables work, but to be able to build any modern software.\nThe basic syntax for tables is to make a curly brace { (same key as the square brace on most keyboards) to start the table, write some data in the table, then put a closing curly brace } to end the table.\nSo an empty table would look like this:\nmy_cool_table = {}\n\nLists\nLists are usually started by writing the first item, then the second, and so on.\nIf we wanted to make a grocery list in software, it may look like this:\ngroceries = {\n  [1] = \"beans\",\n  [2] = \"bananas\",\n  [3] = \"buns\"\n}\n\nOk maybe your typical grocery list looks different.\nWhat do we do with this data now that we got it?\nWe can access and modify the data as if they were stored in their own variables.\nreturn groceries[1]\n\n=> beans\nFirst we specify the variable name of the table, then in square brackets we put the number we want.\nYou can access them in any order and modify them as needed:\nprint(groceries[3])\ngroceries[1] = \"coffee beans\"\nprint(groceries[1])\n\nbuns\ncoffee beans\nThe order you define them in doesn't matter:\ngroceries = {\n  [3] = \"beans\",\n  [1] = \"bananas\",\n  [2] = \"buns\"\n}\n\nThe number in square brackets is the key.\nA key that is part of a numeric sequence of keys such as this list is often called an index.\nSo \"bananas\" has an index of 1.\nThe plural of index is indices.\nDon't forget the commas between each item in your list or you will get quite the error message:\n[string \"groceries = {...\"]:3: '}' expected (to close '{' at line 1) near '['\nWhen you are missing a comma between items, it thinks it has reached the end of the table but then errors out when it goes to close the table but sees another item instead of the close curly bracket }.\nAnother issue you may run into is if you try to access a key that has no data.\nThere is no 4th item in our table so if we try to access it:\nprint(groceries[4])\n\nWe get back nil, the same way we would if we tried to access a variable name that has no data assigned to it.\nWriting out large lists can become a headache when we have to manually number each item in a list:\ngroceries = {\n  [1] = \"beans\",\n  [2] = \"bananas\",\n  [3] = \"buns\",\n  [4] = \"blueberries\",\n  [5] = \"butter\",\n  [6] = \"broccoli\",\n  [7] = \"basil\"\n}\n\nWhat if we remove an item or we want to move something to a different position in the list?\nWhat a pain to have to re-index everything.\nThankfully there is shorthand way of writing lists:\ngroceries = {\n  \"beans\",\n  \"bananas\",\n  \"buns\",\n  \"blueberries\",\n  \"butter\",\n  \"broccoli\",\n  \"basil\"\n}\n\nThis is identical to the code written above, except now the indices are auto-generated for me.\n\"basil\" has an index of 7 since it is the 7th item in the list, but if I cut and pasted it to the top of my list, it's index would be 1 and everything below it would be renumbered accordingly.\nLooping over lists\nIf we wanted to print our grocery list, we could say something like:\nprint(groceries[1])\nprint(groceries[2])\nprint(groceries[3])\nprint(groceries[4])\n-- and so on...\n\nBut that is quite repetitious and requires updating if the size of our list changes.\nLuckily we already know about while loops.\nindex = 1\n\nwhile groceries[index] ~= nil do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index + 1\nend\n\nSee how instead of accessing each item as groceries[1], groceries[2]... we can just use a variable in the square brackets instead of a number.\nThen inside the loop we bump the number up and access the next item in the list.\nThe loop stops when the index goes beyond the last item in the list and there is nothing there.\nSo when index 8 is read, groceries[8] is nil and the while condition is no longer true.\nWhile conditions don't even need a boolean expression.\nIt can know whether or not to continue simply if the given item has data or is nil.\nIt can be simplified to read:\nindex = 1\n\nwhile groceries[index] do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index + 1\nend\n\nAgain, it knows to exit when it sees false or nil.\nThe caveat to this would be if you make a special list with false in it:\ngroceries = {\n  \"beans\",\n  \"bananas\",\n  false,\n  \"blueberries\",\n  \"butter\",\n  \"broccoli\",\n  \"basil\"\n}\n\nWhen the while loop gets to the third item in the list and sees false, it would stop looping before it reads the rest.\nIt's not typically a good idea to mix and match different data types in a list because of issues like this, however, we could work around this if we needed to.\nThere is a special operator for tables to get the size of the list.\nprint(#groceries)\n\n7\nAn easy way to remember the # operator is to remember that it returns the # of items in a list.\nUsing this operator we could write our while loop in a different way.\nindex = 1\n\nwhile index \nYou could even tweak this slightly to read the list backwards if you wanted to:\nindex = #groceries\n\nwhile index > 0 do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index - 1\nend\n\nNotice we are subtracting from the index with each loop in order to accomplish this.\nExercises\n\nTry to modify the while loop to only print every other item in the grocery list. (Hint: instead of incrementing by 1 on each read, you want to increment more.)\nWrite a while loop that counts to 10 and populates an empty table with the same item 10 times. (Hint: you assign to indices just like variables, list[index] = \"hi\".)\n\n"},"pages/01-14-tables-2.html":{"url":"pages/01-14-tables-2.html","title":"1.14 - Tables (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"Tables (part 2)\nIn the last section we saw how simple it was to make a list.\nWorking with the list was a little tricky at first but hopefully not too bad.\nIf we rewind back, we can remember that we created a table by assigning some keys values.\nboxes = {\n  [1] = \"John Doe\",\n  [2] = \"Amanda Parker\",\n  [3] = \"Tyler Reese\"\n}\n\nThink of it like post office boxes and we label each box with a unique number.\nWhenever we reference a postal box, we do so by referencing the number within the array (list) of boxes: boxes[2].\nThe label, or key, is ultimately arbitrary though.\nFor making a list, we label things in an incremental order to make them easier to loop over and to give us a sense of linear sequence.\nKeys don't need to be numbers.\nThey could just as well be strings:\ncoins = {\n  [\"half\"] = \"50 cents\",\n  [\"quarter\"] = \"25 cents\",\n  [\"dime\"] = \"10 cents\",\n  [\"nickel\"] = \"5 cents\",\n  [\"penny\"] = \"1 cent\"\n}\n\nWhich would be accessed just the same way:\nprint(coins[\"nickel\"])\n\n5 cents\nThis can be really useful for doing a lookup if we instead use a variable for the key.\nTry this one out:\ncoins = {\n  [\"half\"] = \"50 cents\",\n  [\"quarter\"] = \"25 cents\",\n  [\"dime\"] = \"10 cents\",\n  [\"nickel\"] = \"5 cents\",\n  [\"penny\"] = \"1 cent\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Which coin do you have?\")\nresponse = io.read()\n\nprint(\"Your coin is worth \" .. coins[response] .. \".\")\n\nThis isn't far off from how certain databases and digital services work.\nItems are stored in a unique key that can be referenced for getting a definition out of later.\nThat's why this data structure is sometimes called a dictionary.\nRemember, we can add items to a table after it is defined:\ncoins[\"silver dollar\"] = \"1 dollar\"\n\nAnother shortcut Lua gives us is we don't need to use the square braces or quotes when adding keys that are strings.\ncoins.nickel = \"5 cents\"\n\nThe limitation with doing this is the keys defined this way can't have spaces or special characters.\nThey must be valid in the same way variable names are valid.\ncoins.silver dollar = \"1 dollar\"  -- INVALID\ncoins.silver_dollar = \"1 dollar\"  -- Valid\ncoins.100 = \"1 dollar\" -- INVALID\n\nYou can use variable names for keys when creating the table too:\ncolor = \"purple\"\ndescription = \"the best color\"\ncolors = {\n  [color] = description\n}\n\nprint(colors.purple)\nprint(colors[color]) -- prints the same thing\n\nBy convention, strings are typically used for dictionary-like tables while lists are numbers.\nDon't make the mistake of thinking these are the same:\nlist = {\n  1 = \"some item\",\n  [\"1\"] = \"a unique item\"\n}\n\nYou could use other data types as keys, but you might find your results to be very unexpected:\ncrazy_list = {\n  [true] = \"works\",\n  [false] = \"works\",\n  [\"true\"] = \"not the same\",\n  [\"false\"] = \"not the same\"\n}\n\nprint(crazy_list[true])\nprint(crazy_list[false])\nprint(crazy_list[\"true\"])\nprint(crazy_list[\"false\"])\n\ncrazy_key = {}\ncrazy_list = {\n  [crazy_key] = \"works\"\n}\nprint(crazy_list[crazy_key])\n\ncrazy_list = {\n  [nil] = \"doesn't work!\"\n}\nprint(crazy_list[nil])\n\nThrows an error:\n[string \"crazy_list = {...\"]:2: table index is nil\nValues in a table can be any type of data, including functions:\ncat = {\n  color = \"gray\",\n  smelly = true,\n  make_sound = function()\n    print(\"meyuow!\")\n  end\n}\n\ncat.make_sound()\n\nExercises\n\nRemember the early function we made that returned the animal sounds?

If we don't specify a step size it will default to 1.\n\nLet's say we wanted to print out only even numbers.\nWe could change the starting number to 2 and set the size of the step (3rd parameter) to 2:\nfor number = 2, 10, 2 do\n  print(number)\nend\n\nIf we wanted to iterate, or loop over and read each item in a list, it would look similar to a while loop.\nLet's look at the while loop example again just for comparison:\nitems = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\nindex = 1\n\nwhile index \nitems = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\n\nfor index = 1, #items do\n  print(items[index])\nend\n\nWe could also count down by changing the parameters around and setting the step to a negative 1.\nitems = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\n\nfor index = #items, 1, -1 do\n  print(items[index])\nend\n\nIn this case the index starts at the position of the last item and stops when it gets to the stop number, 1.\nExercises\n\nModify the previous loop so that it only prints every other item in the list.\n\n"},"pages/01-16-for-loops-2.html":{"url":"pages/01-16-for-loops-2.html","title":"1.16 - For loops (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"For loops (part 2)\nWe can create a different style of for loop using functions, but in order to do that, we need to understand another aspect of functions we haven't yet covered.\nFunctions can return multiple values.\nsort_numbers = function(a, b)\n  if a > b then\n    return a, b\n  end\n  return b, a\nend\n\nbigger, smaller = sort_numbers(12, 18)\n\nprint(bigger)\nprint(smaller)\n\nThis function takes two numbers, checks to see which is bigger, then returns both the bigger number first then the smaller number second.\nNotice we did this by putting a comma in the return statement then providing a second value after the comma.\nLikewise, we were able to capture both values into variables by putting the first variable name, a comma, then the second variable (bigger, smaller =).\nWe don't need to capture everything returned from a function.\nWe could have just as easily called the function and only captured the bigger number if that's all we wanted from it.\nbigger = sort_numbers(12, 18)\n\nGeneric for loops\nLet's take a look at the sibling to the numeric for loop called the generic for loop.\nIt's called generic for loop because it takes a function that makes it behave in different ways for different situations.\nIt doesn't do anything on its own.\nIt relies on the function to tell it how to behave.\nipairs\nHere's what generic for loops look like:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index in ipairs(list) do\n  print(index, list[index])\nend\n\nipairs takes our for loop and makes it iterate over each item in the list and gives us an index variable to work with inside the loop.\nBut wait, there's more!\nipairs provides us with another variable that holds the value of the item at that index.\nTry it out yourself:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  print(index, value)\nend\n\nAh yes, so convenient!\nThere is one gotcha with doing this.\nIf you wanted to edit the table from inside the loop, you need to access the table directly:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  list[index] = string.upper(value)\nend\n\nprint(list[1])\n\nIf you try to just edit the value:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  value = string.upper(value)\nend\n\nprint(list[1])\n\nthe list won't be modified, because value is just a copy of the data that's actually in the list.\nYou're editing a temporary copy.\npairs\nAnother function for programming for loops with special functionality is pairs.\nThis will iterate over every key in a table:\ntable = {\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nEven indices:\ntable = {\n  'a',\n  'b',\n  'c',\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nNo sneaking past pairs for any of these keys either:\ntable = {\n  [1] = 'a',\n  [2] = 'b',\n  [3] = 'c',\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark',\n  [true] = false,\n  [{}] = 'what?'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nAn easy way to remember the difference between ipairs and pairs is the \"i\" in ipairs stands for index.\nSure there's a difference when working with weird tables like the one above, but why can't we just use pairs for regular list-style tables?\ntable = {\n  [2] = 'b',\n  [3] = 'c',\n  [1] = 'a'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\n3   c\n2   b\n1   a\nAs you can see, the order of the items isn't guaranteed with pairs.\nipairs is also optimized to handle numeric keys and will generally perform faster, so it's good to know the difference.\nUnder the generic-for-loop hood\nipairs and pairs are just regular functions that we invoke.\nThey return a function (yes, a function that returns a function!) and this returned function programs our loop to behave how we want.\nfor key, value in iterator, list, start_number do\n  print(index)\nend\n\nSo this is what a generic for loop really looks like without the help of ipairs or pairs.\nIt requires 3 parameters that ipairs/pairs provides data back to the key and value variables that we can use inside the loop.\niterator, list, start_number are all variables we would otherwise have to define without their help.\n\niterator would be a function we provide to the loop\nlist would be what we want to iterate over\nstart_number would be the starting index in the list\n\nlist = {'a', 'b', 'c'}\n\niterator, list, start_number = ipairs(list)\n\nfor index, value in iterator, list, start_number do\n  print(index)\nend\n\nipairs gives us an iterator to pass to the for loop, as well as our list we already had, and a starting number.\nWe can print the results of ipairs and see the 3 things it gives us:\nprint(ipairs(list))\n\nfunction: 0x156a3f0    table: 0x1572aa0    0\nSo to say it again, generic for loops require 3 things: an iterator function, our list, and a number.\nIn order to not have to write them ourselves, we generated those 3 things by invoking ipairs then passing them into the for loop parameters.\nDon't fret too much if this seems confusing right now because we're not going to need to write custom for loops or custom iterators.\nNumeric versus generic: which to use?\nNumeric for loops are good for simple counting but perform just as well or maybe even better than generic for loops.\nGeneric for loops are more adaptable.\nIf you have a situation where either would work, just use whichever you want.\nIt really won't make any difference.\nExercises\n\nMake a list and then write both a numeric for loop and generic for loop that iterate over the list and print each item. Compare the two approaches.\nMake a table with animals for keys and the sounds they make for the key values. Make a for loop that uses pairs to iterate over each and change the noises to all capital letters.\n\n"},"pages/01-17-scopes.html":{"url":"pages/01-17-scopes.html","title":"1.17 - Scopes","keywords":"","body":"Scopes\nWhen defining functions, we define parameters for those functions which work like regular variables.\nIf we try to access a parameter outside a function we will see that it is nil.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  print(a, b)\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(a, b)\n\nThe parameters a and b are local variables.\nWe've seen local variables with for loops, where the variable counting_number couldn't be accessed outside the for loop:\nfor counting_number = 1, 4 do\n  print(counting_number)\nend\n\nprint(counting_number)\n\nFunctions, for loops, and while loops create a scope each time they are ran.\nThings created in the scope, including local variables, are destroyed when that loop or function invoke is done.\nThis is how the program tidies up after itself and keeps the computer from running out of memory.\nThe process of removing unused data from memory and releasing control of that memory is called garbage collection.\nLua does this for us so we don't have to think about it.\nVariables we create normally don't follow the same rules.\nThey will continue to exist after the scope they were created in has been destroyed.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  text = \"I'm not going away.\"\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(text)\n\nEventually all these variables we make will fill up memory unnecessarily.\nThis can also be problematic if we accidentally make two variables but use the same name.\nx = 2\n\naddition = function(a, b)\n  -- This modifies the x at the top!\n  x = 9\n  return a + b\nend\n\nprint(x)\nresult = addition(x, y)\nprint(x)\n\nWhen you write a large program, you'll inevitably make two variables with the same name, so this could be a huge issue.\nThe solution is to make our variables local variables by putting the keyword local before all our variables when we create them.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  local text = \"I'm only accessible inside the function.\"\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(text)\n\nNow text is only in the scope of the function and not getting into other people's business.\nIf you don't write local before a variable, then what you are creating is a global variable.\nIt's a shame that variables are global unless we explicitly tell them not to be.\nThere is never a reason to create global variables if you have enough knowledge to know not to.\nSo as a best practice, all code examples going forward, only local variables will be created.\nLet's see a few more examples:\nlocal number = 12\n\n-- This function has no parameters\nlocal print_numbers = function()\n  -- This works. You can see variables outside the function\n  print('number:', number)\n  -- This doesn't work. The variable didn't exist\n  -- at the time \"print_numbers\" was created.\n  print('number2:', number2)\nend\n\nlocal number2 = 18\n\nprint_numbers()\n\n-- We already \"declared\" number. We don't write \"local\" again.\nnumber = 13\n\nprint_numbers()\n\nNotice when it printed that it knew number was updated to 13 but couldn't track number2.\nAs long as a variable was created before the scope (function's scope in this case) was created then it will always track the latest value.\nAs a reminder, we already saw with the for loop and while loop that you can modify variables in the outer, or parent, scope:\nlocal number = 1\n\nwhile number \nThis also works with functions:\nlocal number = 1\n\nlocal mutate_number = function()\n  number = 7\nend\n\nprint(number)\nmutate_number()\nprint(number)\n\nWhat if you make two variables with the same name in two different scopes?\nTry running this one:\nlocal number = 18\n\nlocal shadowing = function()\n  local number = 6\n  print(number)\nend\n\nprint(number)\nshadowing()\n\nThe inner number does not affect the outer number in any way.\nThe outer number is not accessible inside the function as long as the inner number exists.\nIf a variable has the same name as another variable in a parent scope then the parent scope variable becomes inaccessible: this is called shadowing.\nTypically you would want to avoid shadowing if at least for the reason that using the same variable name twice in the same file can make the code harder to read and more prone to errors being introduced.\nOne more interesting things with scopes.\nNormally a function cannot see itself:\nlocal self_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference) -- This will be nil!\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nIt doesn't see itself because the variable is still being created when the function is being created.\nBut remember that if a variable exists before the function does, it can see the latest up-to-date content of that variable.\nSo here's the trick to make that work:\nlocal self_reference = nil\nself_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference)\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nThe variable is declared, even though we assigned nil to it.\nAssigning nil to get a variable declared is pretty common, so Lua includes a shorthand way of declaring empty variables:\nlocal self_reference\nself_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference)\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nThis may seem silly that a function would need to access itself, but there are some very powerful applications for this that we will see later on.\nExercises\n\nDeclare a global variable inside a function, x = 5 (no local keyword) then try to print the variable from outside the function.

and take a look at our first line.\nWe defined a function called love.draw, which implies there is a table called love and we created a key in it called draw.\nIndeed this is the case, but somehow the function was invoked without using having to write love.draw() and invoke it ourselves.\nThis requires a high-level explanation of what the engine is doing with our file.\nWhen LÖVE is run, before our main.lua file is ran, a table called love is defined as a global variable.\nWe can assign functions to this table (love.draw) and access functions already defined in it (love.graphics.print).\nlove.graphics.print has two dots in it, so that means the love table probably looks something like:\nlove = {\n  draw = nil,\n  graphics = {\n    print = function() ... end\n  }\n}\n\nThe love table has a plenty of other tables nested in it, and it puts similar functions in tables together.\nSo all the functions relating to graphics are inside the love.graphics table.\nOnce \"main.lua\" is done running, we've accessed and modified the love table and added some new functionality to it, telling it how to draw to the screen by defining our love.draw function.\nIf we define a function with this name, the game engine will see it and invoke it.\nIn fact, it continuously invokes love.draw many times a second.\nTo prove my point, let's modify main.lua and make it print a number.\nlocal number = 0\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  number = number + 1\n  love.graphics.print(number, 400, 300)\nend\n\nEach time we go to print the number, we increase it by 1.\nRun this program and see how quickly the number climbs.\nThe faster your computer is, the faster the number will move.\nThe love table is a seemingly complex structure of tables inside tables and functions inside those, but we'll gradually learn the structure and purpose of each thing over the course of this chapter.\nIn the next section, let's take a look at the 2nd and 3rd parameters in love.graphics.print and see how they work.\n"},"pages/02-03-geometry.html":{"url":"pages/02-03-geometry.html","title":"2.3 - Geometry","keywords":"","body":"Geometry\nIf you modified the numbers 400 and 300 in main.lua you will have seen that they move the text.\nRealizing that they're some kind of coordinates, let's talk about graphs.\nWhen learning about graphs in geometry class, we learned about an x-axis and y-axis and labeled plotted points along the graph.\nIf you wanted to mark (-2, -4) then you would find where -2 on the x-axis intersects with -4 on the y-axis.\nKnowing that X is horizontal and Y is vertical, if we had (-2, -4) and (1, 2) we could draw it out like this:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[-2,-4],[1,2]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"label\":\"x-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"yAxis\":{\"label\":\"y-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-0\"});\n                    \nThese two points could even be connected to form a 2-dimensional line:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[-2,-4],[1,2]]},{\"attr\":{\"opacity\":1,\"stroke\":\"blue\",\"stroke-width\":4},\"fn\":\"2x\"}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"label\":\"x-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"yAxis\":{\"label\":\"y-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-1\"});\n                    \nBefore we get too far on drawing points and lines, let's look back at our function:\n  love.graphics.print(\"Hello World!\", 400, 300)\n\nThe 400 is the X position and increasing it will move the text further to the right.\nDecreasing the X position will move the text further to the left.\nThe 300 is the Y position, one difference between computers and geometry class is data is calculated from top to bottom, so increasing the Y position moves the text down and decreasing it moves the text up.\nLet's take a look at what our game's graph looks like with the point (5, 3) highlighted:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[5,3]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-2\"});\n                    \nNotice that the top-left corner of our screen is (0, 0), so if you tried to draw any points with negative numbers they would be drawn off screen where we can't see them.\nAnother thing to note is in the game, the coordinates represent how many pixels down and to the right we want to draw.\nSince computer screens are made of so many pixels, you need to use large numbers to make a noticeable difference.\nIf we wanted to draw a polygon (shape) such as a triangle on this graph, we would have to give three points:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[4,1],[1,7],[7,7]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-3\"});\n                    \nIn the same way, we can plot out points in our code and tell it to draw a line to connect the dots.\nLet's use larger numbers though.\nRewrite main.lua to look like this:\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', 50, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100)\nend\n\nThe numbers in this code can be read off in pairs to identify the coordinates: (50, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100)\nLÖVE's physics engine takes the coordinates, starting at the first point and connects them with a line sequentially.\nOnce it reaches the last point, it draws a line from the last point back to the first to close the shape.\nLet's try a rectangle to get some more practice in:\nlove.draw = function()\n  local rectangle = {100, 100, 100, 200, 200, 200, 200, 100}\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', rectangle)\nend\n\nNotice this time instead of passing the numbers directly into love.graphics.polygon, we put them into a list and passed the list in.\nPassing in coordinates both ways has the same effect.\nAnother important thing to think about is if you draw a polygon with 4 or more sides, you need to make sure the points are listed in the correct order.\nConsider the following example:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[1,1],[1,6],[6,6],[6,1]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-4\"});\n                    \nIf we fed the points into the function in a clockwise or counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise order, the rectangle would be drawn the same either way.\nIf we fed the points in from cross directions, we may accidentally draw a bow tie:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[1,1],[1,6],[6,6],[6,1]]},{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"none\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"blue\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"polyline\",\"points\":[[1,1],[6,6],[6,1],[1,6],[1,1]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-5\"});\n                    \nCreating shapes with unclosed sides don't play well with LÖVE's physics engine as such shapes are not physically possible.\nIf you try to do this, you may not see the shape you expect, and perhaps nothing will be drawn.\nExercises\n\nTake a look at the documentation for the function love.graphics.polygon. The example shows the argument 'line' is a string and represents the \"drawMode\". Try changing the \"drawMode\" from 'line' to one of the other available options (see the examples or click the drawMode link on the wiki page). What other option is there? How does it work? Try it out and see how it works!\nTry making a polygon with 5 sides/points.

some sort of polygon to give our entity a physical shape that determines the boundaries of the entity\nbody - holds physical properties such as mass\nfixture - attaches a shape to a body\n\nLet's write a new main.lua from scratch and see how these are all wired up.\nFirst, a world needs to be defined:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 100)\n\nlove.physics.newWorld returns a table, an instance of a world.\nThe table holds functions that allow us to apply attributes to the world.\nIt also holds all the entities in our world, which is currently none on initialization.\nAccording to the documentation on love.physics.newWorld, our 1st and 2nd parameters set the X and Y gravity on our world.\nWe don't want any sideways gravity, but we'll go ahead and set an arbitrary number for the vertical gravity.\nWhile focusing on the world, we should allow the world to know whenever we get an update to the delta time.\nA world without time would be frozen;\nBy letting the world know about the passage of time, it can know whether it needs to make an entity fall another meter or two meters…\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world.update(world, dt)\nend\n\nActually, let's do one trick here.\nWhen calling a function in Lua and the first parameter of the function is the table the function is stored in, you can use a shortcut notation:\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world:update(dt)\nend\n\nAside from being easier to write, you'll see this way of invoking functions used all over the place in the LÖVE documentation.\nFinally, we'll add an entity to the game in 4 steps:\n\nCreate a table to store all the pieces of our entity together. Not entirely necessary but we'll learn later why this step makes things easier.\nCreate a body. This will be added to the entity table and the world.\nCreate the shape we want the entity to have.\nCreate a fixture to attach the body and shape together.\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first

triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nAfter creating the body table inside triangle, we called triangle.body.setMass to set a weight property on our triangle so it can fall.\nNotice we wrote triangle.body:setMass(32), which is the same as saying triangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32) but shorter and more conventional to the way the LÖVE documentation writes.\nWhat's going on inside love.draw looks pretty crazy so let's break the long line up.\n  love.graphics.polygon(\n    'line',\n    triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints())\n  )\n\nWe've used love.graphics.polygon previously so its purpose should already be familiar.\nThe first parameter 'line' is telling it that we want an outline of a shape drawn.\nThe second parameter is a table containing the points that need to be outlined.\nTo get the triangle's points we call triangle.shape:getPoints(), but this only returns the shape of the triangle and the relative position of the points.\nBy then calling triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()) we convert those relative points to their absolute position as that's what the polygon drawing function needs to know so it can draw the triangle exactly where it is supposed to be on the screen.\nLet's put it all together and add one more entity into the mix so the two can interact:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 100)\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first entity\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\n-- Give the triangle some

world:update(dt)\nend\n\nThis is a lot to digest so don't hesitate to re-read through this code several times if necessary.\nThere were a lot of new functions introduced in this section, so in the next section we'll take a deeper look at the documentation and read more about them and their components.\nExercises\n\nTry changing the mass (triangle.body:setMass) and gravity

started, tutorials, and books.\nAn API (application programming interface) is a portion of software that a programmer writes for his/her program to allow fellow programmers to interact with their application.\nAs for LÖVE's programming interface, most of your interactions with the framework are done through the love global variable that the framework purposely exposes.\nAPI documentation is the most fundamental form of software documentation because without it, you would not know what all the functions in the program do unless you were resourceful enough to go in and study all the source code and figure each function out on your own.\nThe documentation for LÖVE (bookmark this!) is written in a wiki style where each table and function has an article that describes how to use it.\nFrom here you should see many modules listed.\nClick on love.physics.\nAgain, love.physics is just a table with functions in it.\nSo within the article we see each of the functions stored in it including the functions love.physics.newBody which we used to create our entities' bodies, love.physics.newPolygonShape which we used to create their shapes, and  love.physics.newFixture which we used to create their fixtures.\nWe also see love.physics.newWorld which created our world table.\nLet's look at the first function's article.\nClicking on the article for love.physics.newBody we get a synopsis showing how the function might be used, along with a description of its parameters and what the function returns.\nOver the course of different versions of the framework, functions may be modified so in the case of this function you can see examples of how to use it differently in different versions of LÖVE.\nSince the function lists that it returns a body, click the link to go over to the article on the body table's documentation.\nThere's a lot of functions here that set properties on the body and get properties from the body.\nOne of them is the body:setMass function we used to give our entity weight.\nWe can see that it takes one parameter and that the parameter is meant to simulate how many kilograms of mass the body has.\nWe originally told it that our triangle in the last section weighed 32 kilograms, which if you think the object fell too fast or too slow then you may need to adjust your world's gravity to match your expectation.\nNow let's go back to love.physics for a moment and take a look at one of the other components we added to our previous code, the fixture.\nWe previously created a fixture table by calling triangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape).\nHowever, we haven't seen any of these functions in the fixture table that could come in handy.\nFor instance, we could give our triangle bounciness by invoking fixture:setRestitution.\nOur triangle fixture is named triangle.fixture though, not fixture.\nIf 0 is no bounciness (default) and 1 is 100%, try modifying the game code and adding a restitution of 75%:\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\nTry running the game and see how that works.\nIf you set the restitution to 1 or higher then the triangle won't stop bouncing and will bounce itself right off the screen.\nCallbacks\nLet's backtrack now to the main article about the love table.\nIf you scroll down a little on the page, you'll see a section titled \"Callbacks\" that contains some functions we've become familiar with such as love.draw and love.update.\nThis is a list of all the functions in the game loop that we have and haven't talked about yet.\nA \"callback\" is a function you create and give to an API (the love table in this case) that will later get invoked as needed.\nCreating functions with these names allow you to tap into specific portions of the game loop and trigger your own events.\nLet's take a look at the love.keypressed callback for instance.\nIn the synopsis you see that it has 3 parameters (the documentation mistakenly calls parameters \"arguments\").\nWe used the first parameter key to see what key was pressed.\nIf you ever need to know what keys are available, you can click on the link provided next to the parameter name, KeyConstant to see a well-defined list of all the available key strings passed in to this parameter.\nThe second parameter scancode we didn't talk about, but it has a well-defined Scancode article explaining what it is.\nIf you are not familiar with scancodes, take a minute to read it and perhaps you'll learn about a feature you may want to use in your game.\nOne more callback we'll look at while we're here is love.focus.\nTake a moment to stop here and read what it does and what parameters it takes before continuing.\nNow it would be really cool if we were making a game and when the user switched to another application window, the game automatically paused for the user.\nSo first let's start by implementing a pause feature in our earlier game code:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first entity\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\n-- Give the triangle some weight\ntriangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32)\ntriangle.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(100, 100, 200, 100, 200, 200)\ntriangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape)\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\n-- Another entity\nlocal bar = {}\nbar.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 450, 'static')\nbar.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(0, 0, 0, 20, 400, 20, 400, 0)\nbar.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(bar.body, bar.shape)\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', bar.body:getWorldPoints(bar.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nNotice the 3 changes:\n\nWe added a boolean called paused and set it to false\nWe added a new function to key_map so that when \"space\" is pressed, the value of paused is set to not paused. not is an operator for booleans we previously didn't discuss. It simply says \"the opposite of this boolean\". So if paused is true, then setting paused to not paused will set it to false.\nLastly, inside love.update to told the world to update only if we are not paused. So the passage of time in the game world will cease when pressing the space key.\n\nExercises\n\nNow with the documentation in hand, define love.focus and make it so the game pauses when the user clicks away from the game window.\nBonus: make the game print a text saying that the game is paused when paused is true. Go find the documentation for love.graphics.print to see an example on displaying text.\n\n"},"pages/02-09-modules-and-organization.html":{"url":"pages/02-09-modules-and-organization.html","title":"2.9 - Modules and organization","keywords":"","body":"Modules and organization\nEventually when you start writing real programs, you realize if you keep all the code in one file that things can get a bit messy.\nPutting your code in separate files helps you not only keep your different pieces of code separated from each other, but it helps you visualize the structure of your program.\nLet's start with a single main.lua file and we'll then split it into different files:\nlocal my_cool_functon = function()\n  love.graphics.print('This function came from function-module.lua', 100, 100, 0, 2)\nend\n\nlocal my_cool_table = {}\nmy_cool_table.print_stuff = function()\n  love.graphics.print('This function came from table-module.lua', 100, 200, 0, 2)\nend\n\nprint('my_cool_function is', my_cool_function)\nprint('my_cool_table is', my_cool_table)\n\nWhen we go to run the code, we get a blank window because we're not drawing anything.\nWe do see our print statements output our function and table to the console though:\nmy_cool_function is     function: 0x41f2abc0\nmy_cool_table is        table: 0x41f2aa08\nModules and require\nThink of your Lua files as giant functions that get invoked whenever you load the file.\nJust like a function, you can return values from your files.\nIf you load one Lua file from another, you will get whatever value is returned.\nLet's modify our previous code.\nFirst define these two new files in the game folder:\nfunction-module.lua\nreturn function()\n  love.graphics.print('This function came from function-module.lua', 100, 100, 0, 2)\nend\n\ntable-module.lua\nlocal my_cool_table = {}\nmy_cool_table.print_stuff = function()\n  love.graphics.print('This function came from table-module.lua', 100, 200, 0, 2)\nend\n\nreturn my_cool_table\n\nThen update main.lua:\nlocal function_module = require('function-module')\nlocal table_module = require('table-module')\n\nprint('function_module is', function_module)\nprint('table_module is', table_module)\n\nLet's start from the top.\nIn function-module.lua we write a return statement that returns a function with no name.\nWe don't invoke the function, we just return it as a value the same way a function may return a number or string.\nLikewise in table-module.lua we defined a table (with a function in it) and returned the table on the last line of the file.\nThe function name and local variable name my_cool_table is inconsequential and can't be seen outside the table-module.lua file as modules have their own scope.\nIn main.lua we are requiring function-module using a built-in Lua function, require.\nrequire takes one argument, a string that equals the name of your file and it then invokes that file and returns back a function which we assign to a new variable function_module.\nWe then do the same thing for table-module.lua. We require it, which invokes it and returns back whatever that file returns.\nIn this case is a table.\nNotice that when we pass in the filenames as arguments we just give the first part of the filename without the extension \".lua\" at the end.\nThis function expects that any file it is requiring is a Lua file.\nAfter we required the files, we printed the values of those variables, so you should see the results of the print statements appear in the console like before:\nfunction_module is      function: 0x40479548\ntable_module is table: 0x40479bc8\nWe pulled in the return values from the other two files into our main.lua file and printed the values, but since we didn't invoke the functions from those two files then we got a blank game window when running the program.\nLet's define a love.draw in main.lua like before and invoke the functions we got back from both modules:\nlocal function_module = require('function-module')\nlocal table_module = require('table-module')\n\nprint('function_module is', function_module)\nprint('table_module is', table_module)\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  function_module()\n  table_module.print_stuff()\nend\n\nWe were able to invoke the functions and use the returned data as if it were all in the same file.\nOrganizing modules\nIt may help to see a real example of using modules in a game, so let's take our previous game code from 2.8 - Reading documentation and see how we can separate out functionality.\nThe first thing we did in our game was define a world, so let's start by putting our world-related code in a dedicated file named world.lua:\n-- world.lua\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\nreturn world\n\nRemember that you need the return statement at the end of your files or else the code will return nil when you go to require it and this could cause all kinds of unexepcted errors when you run it.\nNext let's create a folder named entities that we can keep all our game entities in.\nWe plan on creating more entities so it will help to keep them all together.\nIn the entities folder, create a file and name it triangle.lua.\nWe'll cut all the code from the original main.lua that related to our triangle entity and put it here:\n-- entities/triangle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\ntriangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32)\ntriangle.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(100, 100, 200, 100, 200, 200)\ntriangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape)\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\nreturn triangle\n\nNotice how we are requiring the world table from world.lua, because we need to access that table in this entity's file so we can add the entity to the world.\nWe also need to do the same thing as above with the bar entity:\n-- entities/bar.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal bar = {}\nbar.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 450, 'static')\nbar.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(0, 0, 0, 20, 400, 20, 400, 0)\nbar.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(bar.body, bar.shape)\n\nreturn bar\n\nNow our main.lua should only contain our key map and love functions:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal bar = require('entities/bar')\nlocal triangle = require('entities/triangle')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', bar.body:getWorldPoints(bar.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world:update(dt)\nend\n\nOur two entities and world get pulled into main.lua and everything should run exactly as before.\nOne thing to note is that even though we require world.lua 3 times in our code, it is the same world and not 3 copies.\nThis is because Lua knows to only run a module the first time you require it and not invoke it again.\nOnce it runs the first time, the returned results are stored in memory for the next time you try to require it.\nWe can prove this by adding a print statement to world.lua:\n-- world.lua\n\nprint(\"This is the world\")\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\nreturn world\n\nHow many times does \"This is the world\" get printed to the console?\nExercises\n\nTry creating two new modules; One that returns a string and one that returns a number.\n\n"},"pages/02-10-collision-callbacks.html":{"url":"pages/02-10-collision-callbacks.html","title":"2.10 - Collision callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Collision callbacks\nWhen writing a game such as a platformer you may want something special to happen when two objects collide.\nIf it's a powerup, for instance, you may want the powerup to despawn (be removed from the world) if a player touches it and then give the player a special ability (think Mario and mushrooms).\nIf a player and an enemy bump into each other, you may want the player's health to decrement.\nThe world table has a method that allows you to program in functionality like this for when two entities collide.\nIt does this by allowing you to create callbacks as we learned before, but these callbacks are triggered before, during, or after collision.\nTake a look at World:setCallbacks.\nIf you look at the parameters for World:setCallbacks, you see it can take four functions.\nThe description of these parameters helps explain when the functions will be called.\nbeginContact and endContact should be self explanatory; They happen at the point where contact begins and ends in a collision, but preSolve and postSolve may not be as obvious.\nNonetheless, let's edit the previously-created world.lua file and write some collision callbacks to test this functionality.\n-- world.lua\n\nlocal begin_contact_counter = 0\nlocal end_contact_counter = 0\nlocal pre_solve_counter = 0\nlocal post_solve_counter = 0\n\nlocal begin_contact_callback = function()\n  begin_contact_counter = begin_contact_counter + 1\n  print('beginContact called ' .. begin_contact_counter ..

Parameters:\n-- {fixture} fixture_a - first fixture object in the collision.\n-- {fixture} fixture_b - second fixture object in the collision.\n-- {contact} contact - world object created on and at the point of\n--   contact.

Let's create new entities to represent the ball and paddle:\n-- entities/ball.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\nentity.body:setMass(32)\nentity.body:setLinearVelocity(300, 300)\nentity.shape = love.physics.newCircleShape(0, 0, 10)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setRestitution(1)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 560, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(180, 20)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nBefore we try and run anything, take a look at a few things we've done differently in defining these entities than we've previously done.\n\nIn ball.lua we are defining a circle shape instead of a polygon. This means we have no sides or corner points we can reference when spawning or tracking the position of this object. Circles have to be tracked from their center point and their boundaries by their radius.\nIn this file we're using Body:setLinearVelocity to apply movement on the ball in a specific direction when the entity spawns.\nIn paddle.lua we are defining a polygon shape, but instead of specifying each point we are using the love.physics.newRectangleShape function to define the shape. This will still generate a polygon as before, but instead of specifying each point in the shape we are giving a height and width and allowing it to figure out the shape we want based on those two parameters. Think of it as a shortcut version of the love.physics.newPolygonShape function.\nThe paddle has a static body while the ball is dynamic. What this entails is the ball will be affected by the paddle but the paddle won't be affected by the ball. Even though the paddle is static, it can be manually repositioned as we'll do later with buttons.\nIn both entity files, we are passing the full entity table as the fixture user data instead of just a string name like before. This will allow us to easily access the entire entity inside the collision callback as we'll see later. You'll want to go back and compare that code from the Collision Callbacks section to these entities, but don't worry if it doesn't make complete sense yet.\n\nNow we need to modify main.lua to load up our new entities:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon(\n    'line',\n    paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints())\n  )\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nTake note of a few things we're doing here:\n\nFor drawing the circle, we need to invoke love.graphics.circle.\nFor drawing the paddle, we still invoke love.graphics.polygon as the rectangle is still a polygon shape.\n\nNow let's remove any print statements in world.lua just to clean things up.\nWe'll leave the callbacks there since we may use them later but we'll leave them empty for now.\nWe'll also set the gravity to 0 because we want the ball to bounce freely like in the real Breakout game and not lose any momentum.\n-- world.lua\n\n-- Called at the beginning of any contact in the world. Parameters:\n-- {fixture} fixture_a - first fixture object in the collision.\n-- {fixture} fixture_b - second fixture object in the collision.\n-- {contact} contact - world object created on and at the point of\n--   contact. When sliding along an object, there may be several.\n--   See further: https://love2d.org/wiki/Contact\nlocal begin_contact_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b, contact)\nend\n\nlocal end_contact_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b, contact)\nend\n\nlocal pre_solve_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b, contact)\nend\n\nlocal post_solve_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b, contact)\nend\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 0)\n\nworld:setCallbacks(\n  begin_contact_callback,\n  end_contact_callback,\n  pre_solve_callback,\n  post_solve_callback\n)\n\nreturn world\n\nWhat happens if you run the game now?\nThe ball flies right off the screen without consequence.\nThere are a couple different ways of preventing the ball from moving off screen.\nPossibly the most simple approach is to put up some walls.\nCan you guess what the code to those walls may look like?\nYup, they will be entities similar to the paddle except that they just sit at the edges of the screen.\nLet's create some entities for that purpose:\n-- entities/boundary-top.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 5, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(800, 10)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nTake a look at these numbers for a minute.\nFor the location of the body we specified 400 pixels.\nSo starting from the top left corner and moving right along the x-axis we've specified the very center of an 800-pixel-wide window.\nThe reason we've done this is because we want the top and bottom wall boundaries to stretch 800 pixels wide, the entire length of the window, and when calling newBody and spawning an entity's body it will spawn the center point of the entity shape at that location.\nNot all entity shapes are square, or even polygonal, so it is simplest for the game engine to center the shape on the body's spawn point rather than using another point of reference on the shape, like the top left corner of the shape (not all shapes have corners).\nIn fact, the ball and paddle spawned centered on the location we gave for their bodies.\nSo we made the walls 800 pixels wide and just to give it a little visibility we made them 10 pixels tall.\nYou would think we'd spawn the wall at the very top of the screen (0 pixels on the y-axis,) but since our walls will be centered to the spawn points we should move down half the height of the wall if we want it all to appear on screen.\nNow the boundary on the bottom will have the same dimensions, but it will be spawned at the bottom of the screen (600 pixels) minus half the height of the wall (5 pixels):\n-- entities/boundary-bottom.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 595, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(800, 10)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nThe left and right boundaries will follow the same pattern except they will be the height of the screen instead of the width of the screen:\n-- entities/boundary-left.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 5, 300, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(10, 600)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\n-- entities/boundary-right.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 795, 300, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(10, 600)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nWe won't see these entities until we require them and draw them on the screen.\nSo modify main.lua to require and draw them the same way we do the ball and paddle:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', boundary_bottom.body:getWorldPoints(boundary_bottom.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', boundary_left.body:getWorldPoints(boundary_left.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', boundary_right.body:getWorldPoints(boundary_right.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', boundary_top.body:getWorldPoints(boundary_top.shape:getPoints()))\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nWhen you run the game, you should see pretty much the same thing as this:\n\nIf you missed anything or are having issues, here's a copy of the completed source code for this section:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-1\nLooking back at our list of minimal requirements we've already completed one thing on our list:\n\nThe ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\n\nThere's still quite a bit more work to complete this list so let's continue in the next section.\nExercises\n\nMaybe it would be better if the boundary lines were even with the screen so we couldn't see them. Modify the boundary positions so it looks like the ball is bouncing off the edge of the screen.\nWhat happens if we require the boundaries but don't draw them in love.draw? Does the game still work?\n\n"},"pages/02-12-breakout-part-2.html":{"url":"pages/02-12-breakout-part-2.html","title":"2.12 - Breakout (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"Breakout (part 2): entity management\nReview\nIn the previous section we made a checklist of requirements and accomplished one of them:\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen\nThe player controls a \"paddle\" entity that hits a ball\nThe ball destroys the bricks\n✔ The ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\nIf the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends\n\nIn the previous exercise, the goal was to move the boundaries so they were just off screen.\nThis gives the effect that the ball is bouncing off the edges of the game window.\n-- entities/boundary-bottom.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 606, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-left.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, -6, 300, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-right.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 806, 300, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-top.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, -6, 'static')\n\nHere they have been moved 6 pixels off screen just to use even numbers and make calculation easier.\nPreviously we also raised the question of whether or not the boundaries would work if we still require'd them in main.lua but didn't draw them in love.draw.\nThe answer is they still work but we don't see them.\nSince they are off screen, that doesn't matter anyway and we can save our program from doing extra work:\n-- main.lua\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nEntity list\nLet's think about the problem of brick entities for a minute.\nWe could create an entity file for each brick, but they are more or less the same except that they spawn in different spots.\nImagine making 50 different entity files and then inside love.draw making 50 lines to draw each brick and so on.\nWhat we can instead do is make an entity file for 1 brick then make a list with 50 copies of it (or however many brick copies we end up fitting on the screen).\nWe can then loop over this list to draw the bricks.\nLet's first create the brick entity file:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nInstead of returning an entity in this file, we returned a function that takes an x-position and y-position as parameters.\nWhen the function gets invoked wherever it is required, it will generate a new entity with those coordinates for its spawn point.\nHere's how we can use it:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nlocal entities = {\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints()))\n\n  for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n    love.graphics.polygon('fill', entity.body:getWorldPoints(entity.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nWe made an entity table with a list of brick entities in it, then in love.draw we made a for loop to draw each entity in the list.\nBefore we change anything else try running the game and taking a look that the bricks appear and that everything works.\nRule of single responsibility\nOur goal for the rest of this section will be to simplify entity management.\nOne strategy we'll have for doing this is to think of each file in our game as having a single responsibility.\nA good sign that we're doing this is main.lua is very small and easy to scan over with the eyes and digest.\nSo what is the responsibility of main.lua?\n\nCreate the callback functions necessary to run the game.\n\nHere's some things it is doing that don't fit that responsibility:\n\nLoad and store all the entities\nFigure out how to draw each type of entity in love.draw\nStore a map of keypresses\n\nImagine our game is an organization and each file is a role in the company.\nOur main file is like the secretary that knows how to handle requests from outsiders.\nIf somebody called asking the secretary about building-maintenance issues, the secretary wouldn't grab plumbing tools and take care of the problem but rather dispatch the person whose responsibility is that exact kind of problem.\nAs the owner of this organization we should know everyone's roles so it's easy to know where each responsibility lies.\nIt will make is easier for us to grow the company to the size we desire.\nOne easy improvement is to not write out all the instructions for drawing each entity within the main file, but rather let each entity file be responsible for every feature of that entity, including how to draw that entity.\nWe may want to get fancy later and draw bricks in different colors, for instance.\nThat could get complicated and we don't want the main file to retain a bunch of code about brick colors and such.\nModifying the entities is as easy as creating draw functions in the entity tables:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    love.graphics.polygon('fill', self.body:getWorldPoints(self.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(pos_x, pos_y)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, pos_x, pos_y, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(180, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    love.graphics.polygon('line', self.body:getWorldPoints(self.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\n-- entities/ball.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'dynamic')\n  entity.body:setMass(32)\n  entity.body:setLinearVelocity(300, 300)\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newCircleShape(0, 0, 10)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setRestitution(1)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    local self_x, self_y = self.body:getWorldCenter()\n    love.graphics.circle('fill', self_x, self_y, self.shape:getRadius())\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nGo ahead and make all the entities return a function with x_pos and y_pos parameters and we'll just add everything to the entity list like the bricks.\nDon't forget to change out the numbers in the love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic') with the arguments being passed in by the function: love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'dynamic').\nFor the boundaries entity files there is no need for entity.draw functions, but still make them return functions with the two parameters.\nNow update the entities list in main.lua to include all the entities:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nlocal entities = {\n  boundary_bottom(400, 606),\n  boundary_left(-6, 300),\n  boundary_right(806, 300),\n  boundary_top(400, -6),\n  paddle(300, 500),\n  ball(200, 200),\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n    if entity.draw then entity:draw() end\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nTake a look at our love.draw function.\nIt is much simpler now that it no longer needs to know how to draw each entity.\nIt just asks the entity if it knows how to draw itself and if it does it tells it to do so.\nRemember that invoking entity:draw() is just shorthand for writing entity.draw(entity) because of the :.\nOk, but putting the entities in a list didn't clean up this file.\nNow this file is responsible for knowing where to spawn the entities and having them in a list just makes this file bigger.\nWell you see the reason we put them in a list is because we want to make a new game file called entities.lua that will be responsible for loading, spawning, and storing all the entities when the game starts up.\nCreate a new file then cut all the entity require statements and the entity list and paste it in the new file:\n-- entities.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nreturn {\n  boundary_bottom(400, 606),\n  boundary_left(-6, 300),\n  boundary_right(806, 300),\n  boundary_top(400, -6),\n  paddle(300, 500),\n  ball(200, 200),\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\nAnd now the top of our main file only needs to load the entities file and it will have the list to use in love.draw and elsewhere as needed:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal entities = require('entities')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nWhen you run the game, you should be seeing something similar to this:\n\nIf you missed anything or are having issues, here's a copy of the completed source code for this section:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-2\nAnd that's about it for entity management.\nWe'll figure out how to handle keypresses for the paddle and everything else in the next section.\nWe'll finish the cleanup in our main file while we're at it.\nExercises\n\nNow that our entities have passed off knowledge on where they spawn over to entities.lua, our left and right boundaries are identical files. Replace boundary-left.lua and boundary-right.lua with a single boundary-vertical.lua file and spawn two copies of that in entities.lua.\n\n"}}}
