progress:\n\nChapter 1 - Programming basics ✔\nChapter 2 - Introducing LÖVE ✔\nChapter 3 - Programming in depth (in progress)\nChapter 4 - LÖVE in depth (to do)\n\nView as a webpage: link\nDownload in ebook format: pdf - epub\nWhat is this book?\nThis book teaches programming from the ground up in the context of Lua and LÖVE.\nIt teaches basic computer science and software building skills along the way, but more importantly, teaches you how to teach yourself and find out how to go about solving a problem or building a solution.\nTools come and go, so the goal is to teach things of value with less focus on the programming language and other tools used to build the software.\nI have been programming since 2007, focusing on teaching myself best practices. Along the way I have found a lot of good and bad tutorials on the right and wrong way to build things and I want to help others avoid getting stuck like I did.\nWho is this for?\n\nAny age group. Kids too, with a bit of demonstration, help and encouragement!\nAnybody that wants to learn basic computer science. This book will touch on several computer science subjects in order to build programs.\nAnybody that wants to learn to program. No prior skills or knowledge required.\nAnybody that wants to learn to make a game. Making games are fun and require learning many things along the way. We'll build a few through this book.\nAnybody that wants to learn Lua. Although we won't dive into the advanced features of the language, we will gain a large understanding on how the language works in order to actually build some things.

4\n\nDivision:\n6 / 2\n\nYou can use parenthesis to tell it which order to do the operations:\n(2 + 2) * (3 + 1)\n\nWhich gives different results than:\n2 + 2 * 3 + 1\n\nIf you give the REPL a single number:\n12\n\nIt will give you back 12, because this can't be simplified down any further.\nYou can also do exponents using the ^ (caret) symbol:\n2^4\n\nNumbers are a type of data, and +, -, /, *, ^, % are operators.\nStatements such as 2 - 2 and 23 * 19 are all operations.\nOne last arithmetic operation we'll cover is modulo, which is done with the modulus operator.\nThe modulus operator is represented in most languages as a % (percent) symbol:\n8 % 3\n\nModulus operations aren't seen in grade school classrooms as often as the rest, but are quite common in software and computer sciences.\nThe way it works is you take the 2nd number and subtract it from the bigger number as many times as possible until the 2nd number is bigger than the 1st.\nThe result is what's left of the 1st number.\nWith 8 % 3, if you keep subtracting 3 from 8 then you end up with 2 left.\nA real world example is time elapsing on an analog clock.\nImagine the face of a clock with the hour hand on noon.\nIf 25 hours pass then the hour hand goes all the way around twice and ends on 1.\nThat would be equivalent to writing:\n25 % 12\n=> 1\n\nThe hour hand resets every time it passes 12, so 13 % 12, 25 % 12, and 37 % 12 would all equal 1.\nLikewise, 10 % 4 results in 2 because 4 goes into 10 twice, and leaves a remainder of 2.\nExercises\n\nTry typing different modulo operations in and guessing what the answer will be.\nTry using negative numbers (-3 + -2).\nTry using a set of parenthesis inside another set of parenthesis. Does it behave as you expect?\nAfter running through all the exercises press the 'up' key in the REPL. What happens and how can this speed up your work?\n\n"},"pages/01-02-strings.html":{"url":"pages/01-02-strings.html","title":"1.2 - Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nNumbers are one type of data that can be operated on.\nLet's explore another data type within the REPL.\nTake a set of quotes and put some text in it and hit ENTER:\n\"hello\"\n\nThe REPL will print hello back to you.\nThis is a string.\nA string is a set of characters (letters and symbols) stringed together as one single piece of data.\nThis string is made of 9 characters:\n\"H-E-L-L-O\"\n\nLike numbers, there are operators to make strings play with each other.\nThe concatenate operator (..) combines strings together:\n\"hello\" .. \"world\"\n\nWhat's the result?\nNotice that the resulting string has no space between the two words.\nIf you wanted a space, you would have to put one in the quotes to be part of the operation:\n\"hello \" .. \"world\"\n\nYou could even make a separate string with the space in it:\n\"hello\" .. \" \" .. \"world\"\n\nStrings can have any characters in them that you want.\n\"abc\" .. \"123\"\n\n\"Япо́нский\" .. \"ロシア語!!\"\n\nExercises\n\nTry using an arithmetic operator on strings \"hello\" / \"world\".

This code gets skipped over.\nThen the next part of the if statement... elseif color == \"green\" then... is true so that section of code underneath it... print(\"Very subtle choice. I like it.\") is ran.\nThe rest of the if statement is skipped without checking if its true or not. So elseif color == \"pink\" then/else are never processed.\n\nExercises\n\nWrite out a function that takes 1 parameter named \"sides\".

chapter.\nOther languages have different names for this data type like \"object\", \"hash\", \"map\" and \"dictionary\", and the features may vary from one programming language to another.\nTables are used to build composite data types like lists, trees, or a big green orc running across the screen.\nComposite data types are higher order data structures created from more primitive data types like numbers and strings.\nThe number of data structures you can create are endless.\nWe need to learn about a few to not only understand how tables work, but to be able to build any modern software.\nThe basic syntax for tables is to make a curly brace { (same key as the square brace on most keyboards) to start the table, write some data in the table, then put a closing curly brace } to end the table.\nSo an empty table would look like this:\nmy_cool_table = {}\n\nLists\nLists are usually started by writing the first item, then the second, and so on.\nIf we wanted to make a grocery list in software, it may look like this:\ngroceries = {\n  [1] = \"beans\",\n  [2] = \"bananas\",\n  [3] = \"buns\"\n}\n\nOk maybe your typical grocery list looks different.\nWhat do we do with this data now that we got it?\nWe can access and modify the data as if they were stored in their own variables.\nreturn groceries[1]\n\n=> beans\nFirst we specify the variable name of the table, then in square brackets we put the number we want.\nYou can access them in any order and modify them as needed:\nprint(groceries[3])\ngroceries[1] = \"coffee beans\"\nprint(groceries[1])\n\nbuns\ncoffee beans\nThe order you define them in doesn't matter:\ngroceries = {\n  [3] = \"beans\",\n  [1] = \"bananas\",\n  [2] = \"buns\"\n}\n\nThe number in square brackets is the key.\nA key that is part of a numeric sequence of keys such as this list is often called an index.\nSo \"bananas\" has an index of 1.\nThe plural of index is indices.\nDon't forget the commas between each item in your list or you will get quite the error message:\n[string \"groceries = {...\"]:3: '}' expected (to close '{' at line 1) near '['\nWhen you are missing a comma between items, it thinks it has reached the end of the table but then errors out when it goes to close the table but sees another item instead of the close curly bracket }.\nAnother issue you may run into is if you try to access a key that has no data.\nThere is no 4th item in our table so if we try to access it:\nprint(groceries[4])\n\nWe get back nil, the same way we would if we tried to access a variable name that has no data assigned to it.\nWriting out large lists can become a headache when we have to manually number each item in a list:\ngroceries = {\n  [1] = \"beans\",\n  [2] = \"bananas\",\n  [3] = \"buns\",\n  [4] = \"blueberries\",\n  [5] = \"butter\",\n  [6] = \"broccoli\",\n  [7] = \"basil\"\n}\n\nWhat if we remove an item or we want to move something to a different position in the list?\nWhat a pain to have to re-index everything.\nThankfully there is shorthand way of writing lists:\ngroceries = {\n  \"beans\",\n  \"bananas\",\n  \"buns\",\n  \"blueberries\",\n  \"butter\",\n  \"broccoli\",\n  \"basil\"\n}\n\nThis is identical to the code written above, except now the indices are auto-generated for me.\n\"basil\" has an index of 7 since it is the 7th item in the list, but if I cut and pasted it to the top of my list, it's index would be 1 and everything below it would be renumbered accordingly.\nLooping over lists\nIf we wanted to print our grocery list, we could say something like:\nprint(groceries[1])\nprint(groceries[2])\nprint(groceries[3])\nprint(groceries[4])\n-- and so on...\n\nBut that is quite repetitious and requires updating if the size of our list changes.\nLuckily we already know about while loops.\nindex = 1\n\nwhile groceries[index] ~= nil do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index + 1\nend\n\nSee how instead of accessing each item as groceries[1], groceries[2]... we can just use a variable in the square brackets instead of a number.\nThen inside the loop we bump the number up and access the next item in the list.\nThe loop stops when the index goes beyond the last item in the list and there is nothing there.\nSo when index 8 is read, groceries[8] is nil and the while condition is no longer true.\nWhile conditions don't even need a boolean expression.\nIt can know whether or not to continue simply if the given item has data or is nil.\nIt can be simplified to read:\nindex = 1\n\nwhile groceries[index] do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index + 1\nend\n\nAgain, it knows to exit when it sees false or nil.\nThe caveat to this would be if you make a special list with false in it:\ngroceries = {\n  \"beans\",\n  \"bananas\",\n  false,\n  \"blueberries\",\n  \"butter\",\n  \"broccoli\",\n  \"basil\"\n}\n\nWhen the while loop gets to the third item in the list and sees false, it would stop looping before it reads the rest.\nIt's not typically a good idea to mix and match different data types in a list because of issues like this, however, we could work around this if we needed to.\nThere is a special operator for tables to get the size of the list.\nprint(#groceries)\n\n7\nAn easy way to remember the # operator is to remember that it returns the # of items in a list.\nUsing this operator we could write our while loop in a different way.\nindex = 1\n\nwhile index \nYou could even tweak this slightly to read the list backwards if you wanted to:\nindex = #groceries\n\nwhile index > 0 do\n  print(index, groceries[index])\n  -- Go to the next index in the list\n  index = index - 1\nend\n\nNotice we are subtracting from the index with each loop in order to accomplish this.\nExercises\n\nTry to modify the while loop to only print every other item in the grocery list. (Hint: instead of incrementing by 1 on each read, you want to increment more.)\nWrite a while loop that counts to 10 and populates an empty table with the same item 10 times. (Hint: you assign to indices just like variables, list[index] = \"hi\".)\n\n"},"pages/01-14-tables-2.html":{"url":"pages/01-14-tables-2.html","title":"1.14 - Tables (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"Tables (part 2)\nIn the last section we saw how simple it was to make a list.\nWorking with the list was a little tricky at first but hopefully not too bad.\nIf we rewind back, we can remember that we created a table by assigning some keys values.\nboxes = {\n  [1] = \"John Doe\",\n  [2] = \"Amanda Parker\",\n  [3] = \"Tyler Reese\"\n}\n\nThink of it like post office boxes and we label each box with a unique number.\nWhenever we reference a postal box, we do so by referencing the number within the array (list) of boxes: boxes[2].\nThe label, or key, is ultimately arbitrary though.\nFor making a list, we label things in an incremental order to make them easier to loop over and to give us a sense of linear sequence.\nKeys don't need to be numbers.\nThey could just as well be strings:\ncoins = {\n  [\"half\"] = \"50 cents\",\n  [\"quarter\"] = \"25 cents\",\n  [\"dime\"] = \"10 cents\",\n  [\"nickel\"] = \"5 cents\",\n  [\"penny\"] = \"1 cent\"\n}\n\nWhich would be accessed just the same way:\nprint(coins[\"nickel\"])\n\n5 cents\nThis can be really useful for doing a lookup if we instead use a variable for the key.\nTry this one out:\ncoins = {\n  [\"half\"] = \"50 cents\",\n  [\"quarter\"] = \"25 cents\",\n  [\"dime\"] = \"10 cents\",\n  [\"nickel\"] = \"5 cents\",\n  [\"penny\"] = \"1 cent\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Which coin do you have?\")\nresponse = io.read()\n\nprint(\"Your coin is worth \" .. coins[response] .. \".\")\n\nThis isn't far off from how certain databases and digital services work.\nItems are stored in a unique key that can be referenced for getting a definition out of later.\nThat's why this data structure is sometimes called a dictionary.\nRemember, we can add items to a table after it is defined:\ncoins[\"silver dollar\"] = \"1 dollar\"\n\nAnother shortcut Lua gives us is we don't need to use the square braces or quotes when adding keys that are strings.\ncoins.nickel = \"5 cents\"\n\nThe limitation with doing this is the keys defined this way can't have spaces or special characters.\nThey must be valid in the same way variable names are valid.\ncoins.silver dollar = \"1 dollar\"  -- INVALID\ncoins.silver_dollar = \"1 dollar\"  -- Valid\ncoins.100 = \"1 dollar\" -- INVALID\n\nYou can use variable names for keys when creating the table too:\ncolor = \"purple\"\ndescription = \"the best color\"\ncolors = {\n  [color] = description\n}\n\nprint(colors.purple)\nprint(colors[color]) -- prints the same thing\n\nBy convention, strings are typically used for dictionary-like tables while lists are numbers.\nDon't make the mistake of thinking these are the same:\nlist = {\n  1 = \"some item\",\n  [\"1\"] = \"a unique item\"\n}\n\nYou could use other data types as keys, but you might find your results to be very unexpected:\ncrazy_list = {\n  [true] = \"works\",\n  [false] = \"works\",\n  [\"true\"] = \"not the same\",\n  [\"false\"] = \"not the same\"\n}\n\nprint(crazy_list[true])\nprint(crazy_list[false])\nprint(crazy_list[\"true\"])\nprint(crazy_list[\"false\"])\n\ncrazy_key = {}\ncrazy_list = {\n  [crazy_key] = \"works\"\n}\nprint(crazy_list[crazy_key])\n\ncrazy_list = {\n  [nil] = \"doesn't work!\"\n}\nprint(crazy_list[nil])\n\nThrows an error:\n[string \"crazy_list = {...\"]:2: table index is nil\nValues in a table can be any type of data, including functions:\ncat = {\n  color = \"gray\",\n  smelly = true,\n  make_sound = function()\n    print(\"meyuow!\")\n  end\n}\n\ncat.make_sound()\n\nExercises\n\nRemember the early function we made that returned the animal sounds?

able to capture both values into variables by putting the first variable name, a comma, then the second variable (bigger, smaller =).\nWe don't need to capture everything returned from a function.\nWe could have just as easily called the function and only captured the bigger number if that's all we wanted from it.\nbigger = sort_numbers(12, 18)\n\nGeneric for loops\nLet's take a look at the sibling to the numeric for loop called the generic for loop.\nIt's called generic for loop because it takes a function that makes it behave in different ways for different situations.\nIt doesn't do anything on its own.\nIt relies on the function to tell it how to behave.\nipairs\nHere's what generic for loops look like:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index in ipairs(list) do\n  print(index, list[index])\nend\n\nipairs takes our for loop and makes it iterate over each item in the list and gives us an index variable to work with inside the loop.\nBut wait, there's more!\nipairs provides us with another variable that holds the value of the item at that index.\nTry it out yourself:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  print(index, value)\nend\n\nAh yes, so convenient!\nThere is one gotcha with doing this.\nIf you wanted to edit the table from inside the loop, you need to access the table directly:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  list[index] = string.upper(value)\nend\n\nprint(list[1])\n\nIf you try to just edit the value:\nlist = {'dog', 'cat', 'mouse'}\nfor index, value in ipairs(list) do\n  value = string.upper(value)\nend\n\nprint(list[1])\n\nthe list won't be modified, because value is just a copy of the data that's actually in the list.\nYou're editing a temporary copy.\npairs\nAnother function for programming for loops with special functionality is pairs.\nThis will iterate over every key in a table:\ntable = {\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nEven indices:\ntable = {\n  'a',\n  'b',\n  'c',\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nNo sneaking past pairs for any of these keys either:\ntable = {\n  [1] = 'a',\n  [2] = 'b',\n  [3] = 'c',\n  cat = 'meow',\n  dog = 'bark',\n  [true] = false,\n  [{}] = 'what?'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\nAn easy way to remember the difference between ipairs and pairs is the \"i\" in ipairs stands for index.\nSure there's a difference when working with weird tables like the one above, but why can't we just use pairs for regular list-style tables?\ntable = {\n  [2] = 'b',\n  [3] = 'c',\n  [1] = 'a'\n}\n\nfor key, value in pairs(table) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n\n3   c\n2   b\n1   a\nAs you can see, the order of the items isn't guaranteed with pairs.\nipairs is also optimized to handle numeric keys and will generally perform faster, so it's good to know the difference.\nUnder the generic-for-loop hood\nipairs and pairs are just regular functions that we invoke.\nThey return a function (yes, a function that returns a function!) and this returned function programs our loop to behave how we want.\nfor key, value in iterator, list, start_number do\n  print(index)\nend\n\nSo this is what a generic for loop really looks like without the help of ipairs or pairs.\nIt requires 3 parameters that ipairs/pairs provides data back to the key and value variables that we can use inside the loop.\niterator, list, start_number are all variables we would otherwise have to define without their help.\n\niterator would be a function we provide to the loop\nlist would be what we want to iterate over\nstart_number would be the starting index in the list\n\nlist = {'a', 'b', 'c'}\n\niterator, list, start_number = ipairs(list)\n\nfor index, value in iterator, list, start_number do\n  print(index)\nend\n\nipairs gives us an iterator to pass to the for loop, as well as our list we already had, and a starting number.\nWe can print the results of ipairs and see the 3 things it gives us:\nprint(ipairs(list))\n\nfunction: 0x156a3f0    table: 0x1572aa0    0\nSo to say it again, generic for loops require 3 things: an iterator function, our list, and a number.\nIn order to not have to write them ourselves, we generated those 3 things by invoking ipairs then passing them into the for loop parameters.\nDon't fret too much if this seems confusing right now because we're not going to need to write custom for loops or custom iterators.\nNumeric versus generic: which to use?\nNumeric for loops are good for simple counting but perform just as well or maybe even better than generic for loops.\nGeneric for loops are more adaptable.\nIf you have a situation where either would work, just use whichever you want.\nIt really won't make any difference.\nExercises\n\nMake a list and then write both a numeric for loop and generic for loop that iterate over the list and print each item. Compare the two approaches.\nMake a table with animals for keys and the sounds they make for the key values. Make a for loop that uses pairs to iterate over each and change the noises to all capital letters.\n\n"},"pages/01-17-scopes.html":{"url":"pages/01-17-scopes.html","title":"1.17 - Scopes","keywords":"","body":"Scopes\nWhen defining functions, we define parameters for those functions which work like regular variables.\nIf we try to access a parameter outside a function we will see that it is nil.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  print(a, b)\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(a, b)\n\nThe parameters a and b are local variables.\nWe've seen local variables with for loops, where the variable counting_number couldn't be accessed outside the for loop:\nfor counting_number = 1, 4 do\n  print(counting_number)\nend\n\nprint(counting_number)\n\nFunctions, for loops, and while loops create a scope each time they are ran.\nThings created in the scope, including local variables, are destroyed when that loop or function invoke is done.\nThis is how the program tidies up after itself and keeps the computer from running out of memory.\nThe process of removing unused data from memory and releasing control of that memory is called garbage collection.\nLua does this for us so we don't have to think about it.\nVariables we create normally don't follow the same rules.\nThey will continue to exist after the scope they were created in has been destroyed.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  text = \"I'm not going away.\"\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(text)\n\nEventually all these variables we make will fill up memory unnecessarily.\nThis can also be problematic if we accidentally make two variables but use the same name.\nx = 2\n\naddition = function(a, b)\n  -- This modifies the x at the top!\n  x = 9\n  return a + b\nend\n\nprint(x)\nresult = addition(x, y)\nprint(x)\n\nWhen you write a large program, you'll inevitably make two variables with the same name, so this could be a huge issue.\nThe solution is to make our variables local variables by putting the keyword local before all our variables when we create them.\naddition = function(a, b)\n  local text = \"I'm only accessible inside the function.\"\n  return a + b\nend\n\naddition(1, 2)\n\nprint(text)\n\nNow text is only in the scope of the function and not getting into other people's business.\nIf you don't write local before a variable, then what you are creating is a global variable.\nIt's a shame that variables are global unless we explicitly tell them not to be.\nThere is never a reason to create global variables if you have enough knowledge to know not to.\nSo as a best practice, all code examples going forward, only local variables will be created.\nLet's see a few more examples:\nlocal number = 12\n\n-- This function has no parameters\nlocal print_numbers = function()\n  -- This works. You can see variables outside the function\n  print('number:', number)\n  -- This doesn't work. The variable didn't exist\n  -- at the time \"print_numbers\" was created.\n  print('number2:', number2)\nend\n\nlocal number2 = 18\n\nprint_numbers()\n\n-- We already \"declared\" number. We don't write \"local\" again.\nnumber = 13\n\nprint_numbers()\n\nNotice when it printed that it knew number was updated to 13 but couldn't track number2.\nAs long as a variable was created before the scope (function's scope in this case) was created then it will always track the latest value.\nAs a reminder, we already saw with the for loop and while loop that you can modify variables in the outer, or parent, scope:\nlocal number = 1\n\nwhile number \nThis also works with functions:\nlocal number = 1\n\nlocal mutate_number = function()\n  number = 7\nend\n\nprint(number)\nmutate_number()\nprint(number)\n\nWhat if you make two variables with the same name in two different scopes?\nTry running this one:\nlocal number = 18\n\nlocal shadowing = function()\n  local number = 6\n  print(number)\nend\n\nprint(number)\nshadowing()\n\nThe inner number does not affect the outer number in any way.\nThe outer number is not accessible inside the function as long as the inner number exists.\nIf a variable has the same name as another variable in a parent scope then the parent scope variable becomes inaccessible: this is called shadowing.\nTypically you would want to avoid shadowing if at least for the reason that using the same variable name twice in the same file can make the code harder to read and more prone to errors being introduced.\nOne more interesting things with scopes.\nNormally a function cannot see itself:\nlocal self_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference) -- This will be nil!\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nIt doesn't see itself because the variable is still being created when the function is being created.\nBut remember that if a variable exists before the function does, it can see the latest up-to-date content of that variable.\nSo here's the trick to make that work:\nlocal self_reference = nil\nself_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference)\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nThe variable is declared, even though we assigned nil to it.\nAssigning nil to get a variable declared is pretty common, so Lua includes a shorthand way of declaring empty variables:\nlocal self_reference\nself_reference = function()\n  print(self_reference)\nend\n\nself_reference()\n\nThis may seem silly that a function would need to access itself, but there are some very powerful applications for this that we will see later on.\nExercises\n\nDeclare a global variable inside a function, x = 5 (no local keyword) then try to print the variable from outside the function.

I'm not going to make any recommendations here, because in the end it all comes down to personal preference, but you can check this list by the LÖVE community if you need a starting point. It features different editors (and recommended plugins) for LÖVE and Lua development. Simply pick one.\nTest that LÖVE runs\nWhen you launch LÖVE, (see instructions below on how to do that) you will be greeted with a friendly graphic and the text \"NO GAME\", meaning you are running the engine but didn't give it a game to load.\nmacOS\nOnce you have downloaded the LÖVE binary for macOS (64-bit zipped), proceed to the \"Downloads\" folder and unzip the archive. You should now see an application called \"love\".\n\nmacOS might show you a warning modal, because you are trying to open an application by an unverified developer. If so, right click on the application and choose \"open\" and \"open\" again in the following dialog. You should now be greeted by the no-game screen.\nAddendum: Homebrew\nIf you are familiar with development on a macOS machine, you might have heard of Homebrew. It is a package manager which allows you to install a lot of programs, libraries and so on directly through your Terminal.\nI only recommend this approach for advanced developers who know what they are doing. For completeness sake here are the steps to install LÖVE via Homebrew.\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nbrew tap caskroom/cask\nbrew cask install love\n\nOne of the benefits of this approach is, that you don't have to set up your own terminal alias, because Homebrew also takes care of that.\nWindows\nIf a shortcut for LÖVE didn't appear in the start menu, you should be able to type \"love\" in the search and see it.\nUbuntu\nOpen the \"Ubuntu Software\" application and search \"love2d\".\nClick on the top result and you should see a familiar application description:\n\nClick the \"Install\" button to install it.\nOnce installed, you can search for the \"terminal\" application.\nOnce that is open, type love to launch the application.\nOther GNU/Linux operating systems\nMost distros have LÖVE in their respective repositories:\n\nArch linux-based systems - sudo pacman -Sy love\nFedora-based systems - yum install love\n\nOnce installed from your package manager, open a terminal and type love to test that it runs.\nIf your distro doesn't have LÖVE in the package manager an alternative way to get it is to downloaded the AppImage version from the homepage (https://love2d.org/).\nAppImage files are like a universal executable that works across Linux systems similar to the way an \"exe\" file works on Windows.\nOnce downloaded, open the terminal, change to the directory where you downloaded the AppImage and type the commands:\nchmod a+x love-11.1-linux-x86_64.AppImage # Marks the file as a safe executable\n./love-11.1-linux-x86_64.AppImage\nlove-11.1-linux-x86_64.AppImage should be changed to match the name of the downloaded AppImage file.\nCreate a project folder\nFind a safe place to create a folder and give it the name \"hello\".\nWithin the folder, create a new text file named \"main.lua\".\nThis will be where our game's code goes.\nNote for Windows:\nIn order to create a file with the name \"main.lua\", you may need to first create a new \"Text Document\", right-click on it, click \"Properties\" then from the properties menu change the file extension from reading \"main.lua.txt\" to just \"main.lua\".\nTo avoid having to do this for every Lua file you create in the future you can tell Windows to always show the full name of files, including their extension.\nTo enable this, type \"Control Panel\" in the program search and open the \"Control Panel\" result.\nWithin the control panel, select \"File Explorer Options\".\nClick the \"View\" tab.\nRemove the check mark from the \"Hide extensions for known file types\" and press Apply/OK.\nCreate a test game\nWithin \"main.lua\", write out the following function:\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 400, 300)\nend\n\nNow let's figure out how to run it and see what it does.\nRun the game\nThis will be different for different operating systems.\nmacOS\nStarting your game\nThe simplest way to start a LÖVE game is to drag the whole folder containing the game's source files (not just the main.lua file!) onto the application file.\n\nThis also works with .love files.\nUsing the terminal\nIf you are familiar with the Terminal, you can use it as a more convenient method of starting games.\nAssuming the downloaded \"love\" application is still in your \"Downloads\" folder, open a new Terminal and type the following lines (you need to press return after each line):\n# Switches to the Downloads folder\ncd ~/Downloads/\n\n# Start the LÖVE app\nopen love.app\n\nThis obviously starts LÖVE with a no-game screen since we didn't specify which folder to load. Let's fix this by typing the following command:\n# In my case the full command to start the galaxy demo would be:\n# open -a love.app ~/Downloads/galaxy\nopen -a love.app \n\nUsing a terminal alias\nWe can still improve on the previous method by using an alias. Before we do this, we move the \"love\" application bundle to the Application folder.\n# Move the app from Downloads to Applications.\n~ mv ~/Downloads/love.app/ ~/Applications/love.app\n\nNow try the following command:\n# Start LÖVE by using the script inside of the application bundle.\n~/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love \n\nAs you can see we now can run LÖVE without using the open command, which also has the added benefit of showing the game's console output directly in our terminal.\nOf course it would be rather inconvenient if we had to specify the full path each time we want to run our game, so we'll now set up an alias in your .bash_profile (which basically acts as a configuration file for your bash sessions).\nSince it is a hidden file you might not be able to spot it in your finder, but we can simply edit it through our Terminal.\n# Appends the alias definition to an existing .bash_profile\n# or creates a new one.\necho \"alias love='~/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Use the updated .bash_profile for the current session.\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Start your game through the alias.\nlove \n\nAnd that's it: You can now quickly run your games with the love alias. This is especially handy if you are inside of the game's directory, because all it takes now is a quick love . to start the game.\nWindows\nFind the shortcut to LÖVE and drag and drop it in the game folder like so:\n\nThen right-click on the LÖVE shortcut and you will see a \"Properties\" dialog window similar to this:\n\nThe \"Target\" field may be the same or slightly different depending on your system version.\nWithout deleting the text string currently in the \"Target\" field, append the path to your game folder in quotes to the end.\nYou can copy and paste this path from the folder's address bar.\nFor instance the target path in the picture should go from reading:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\LOVE\\love.exe\"\nto\n\"C:\\Program Files\\LOVE\\love.exe\" \"C:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\hello\"\nNow press \"OK\" to close the Properties dialog and clicking the shortcut will launch the game.\nIf the game ran successfully, you will see a black window with the text \"Hello world!\" in small print.\nGNU/Linux\nIf you know the location of your folder, you can open a terminal and type the command:\nlove \nWhere  has been changed to the actual folder path where your game resides.\nIf you are already navigated into the game folder, you can run a terminal command within that directory:\nlove .\nThe \".\" simply means \"this folder that I am currently in\".\nCongratulations!\nYou've set up your development environment for writing a game in Lua.\nIf you had issues getting through this, reach out to me either through a GitHub issue or my contact information and I will update this guide to including any additional troubleshooting steps for future users.\nNow that our development environment is set up and our first game is running, try modifying the code so the string \"Hello World!\" reads something different.\nIt's pretty apparent that running this function prints to the screen whatever string we give it.\nBut what are the 2nd and 3rd parameters for?\n  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 400, 300)\n\nTry modifying those numbers and see what it does to the text.\n"},"pages/02-02-love-structure.html":{"url":"pages/02-02-love-structure.html","title":"2.2 - LÖVE structure","keywords":"","body":"LÖVE structure\nOpen up \"main.lua\" and take a look at our first line.\nWe defined a function called love.draw, which implies there is a table called love and we created a key in it called draw.\nIndeed this is the case, but somehow the function was invoked without using having to write love.draw() and invoke it ourselves.\nThis requires a high-level explanation of what the engine is doing with our file.\nWhen LÖVE is run, before our main.lua file is ran, a table called love is defined as a global variable.\nWe can assign functions to this table (love.draw) and access functions already defined in it (love.graphics.print).\nlove.graphics.print has two dots in it, so that means the love table probably looks something like:\nlove = {\n  draw = nil,\n  graphics = {\n    print = function() ... end\n  }\n}\n\nThe love table has a plenty of other tables nested in it, and it puts similar functions in tables together.\nSo all the functions relating to graphics are inside the love.graphics table.\nOnce \"main.lua\" is done running, we've accessed and modified the love table and added some new functionality to it, telling it how to draw to the screen by defining our love.draw function.\nIf we define a function with this name, the game engine will see it and invoke it.\nIn fact, it continuously invokes love.draw many times a second.\nTo prove my point, let's modify main.lua and make it print a number.\nlocal number = 0\n\nlove.draw =

chapter.\nIn the next section, let's take a look at the 2nd and 3rd parameters in love.graphics.print and see how they

that they move the text.\nRealizing that they're some kind of coordinates, let's talk about graphs.\nWhen learning about graphs in geometry class, we learned about an x-axis and y-axis and labeled plotted points along the graph.\nIf you wanted to mark (-2, -4) then you would find where -2 on the x-axis intersects with -4 on the y-axis.\nKnowing that X is horizontal and Y is vertical, if we had (-2, -4) and (1, 2) we could draw it out like this:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[-2,-4],[1,2]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"label\":\"x-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"yAxis\":{\"label\":\"y-axis\",\"domain\":[-5,5]},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-0\"});\n

                   \nBefore we get too far on drawing points and lines, let's look back at our function:\n  love.graphics.print(\"Hello World!\", 400, 300)\n\nThe 400 is the X position and increasing it will move the text further to the right.\nDecreasing the X position will move the text further to the left.\nThe 300 is the Y position, one difference between computers and geometry class is data is calculated from top to bottom, so increasing the Y position moves the text down and decreasing it moves the text up.\nLet's take a look at what our game's graph looks like with the point (5, 3) highlighted:\n\n                        \n

                   \nNotice that the top-left corner of our screen is (0, 0), so if you tried to draw any points with negative numbers they would be drawn off screen where we can't see them.\nAnother thing to note is in the game, the coordinates represent how many pixels down and to the right we want to draw.\nSince computer screens are made of so many pixels, you need to use large numbers to make a noticeable difference.\nIf we wanted to draw a polygon (shape) such as a triangle on this graph, we would have to give three points:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[4,1],[1,7],[7,7]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-3\"});\n                    \nIn the same way, we can plot out points in our code and tell it to draw a line to connect the dots.\nLet's use larger numbers though.\nRewrite main.lua to look like this:\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', 50, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100)\nend\n\nThe numbers in this code can be read off in pairs to identify the coordinates: (50, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100)\nLÖVE's physics engine takes the coordinates, starting at the first point and connects them with a line sequentially.\nOnce it reaches the last point, it draws a line from the last point back to the first to close the shape.\nLet's try a rectangle to get some more practice in:\nlove.draw = function()\n  local rectangle = {100, 100, 100, 200, 200, 200, 200, 100}\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', rectangle)\nend\n\nNotice this time instead of passing the numbers directly into love.graphics.polygon, we put them into a list and passed the list in.\nPassing in coordinates both ways has the same effect.\nAnother important thing to think about is if you draw a polygon with 4 or more sides, you need to make sure the points are listed in the correct order.\nConsider the following example:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[1,1],[1,6],[6,6],[6,1]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-4\"});\n                    \nIf we fed the points into the function in a clockwise or counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise order, the rectangle would be drawn the same either way.\nIf we fed the points in from cross directions, we may accidentally draw a bow tie:\n\n                        \n                        functionPlot({\"data\":[{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"red\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"red\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"scatter\",\"points\":[[1,1],[1,6],[6,6],[6,1]]},{\"attr\":{\"fill\":\"none\",\"opacity\":1,\"r\":2,\"stroke\":\"blue\",\"stroke-width\":6},\"fnType\":\"points\",\"graphType\":\"polyline\",\"points\":[[1,1],[6,6],[6,1],[1,6],[1,1]]}],\"disableZoom\":true,\"grid\":true,\"xAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8]},\"yAxis\":{\"domain\":[0,8],\"invert\":true},\"target\":\"#plugin-graph-5\"});\n                    \nCreating shapes with unclosed sides don't play well with LÖVE's physics engine as such shapes are not physically possible.\nIf you try to do this, you may not see the shape you expect, and perhaps nothing will be drawn.\nExercises\n\nTake a look at the documentation for the function love.graphics.polygon. The example shows the argument 'line' is a string and represents the \"drawMode\". Try changing the \"drawMode\" from 'line' to one of the other available options (see the examples or click the drawMode link on the wiki page). What other option is there? How does it work? Try it out and see how it works!\nTry making a polygon with 5 sides/points.

Load game files.\nBegin loop.\nCheck for input from keyboard, joystick, or other peripherals.\nTick time in game.\nRedraw the screen.\nGo back to step 2.\n\nDuring steps in the game loop, LÖVE invokes certain functions inside the love table.\nFor instance, every time the screen needs to be re-drawn, the game loop invokes love.draw() if you defined it.\nIn the step where LÖVE checks for user input, if there is user input, it invokes love.keypressed(PRESSED_KEY) if we defined it.\nThe PRESSED_KEY that is passes in of course depends on what key the user pressed.\nWhen defining love.keypressed, it may look something like this:\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  print('key was pressed:', pressed_key)\nend\n\nLet's modify main.lua to have a contrived example:\nlocal current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local square = {100, 100, 200, 200, 100, 200, 100, 200}\n\n  -- Initialize the square with the default color (white)\n  love.graphics.setColor(current_color)\n  -- Draw the square\n  love.graphics.polygon('fill', square)\nend\n\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  if pressed_key == 'b' then\n    -- Blue\n    current_color = {0, 0, 1, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'g' then\n    -- Green\n    current_color = {0, 1, 0, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'r' then\n    -- Red\n    current_color = {1, 0, 0, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'w' then\n    -- White\n    current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1}\n  end\nend\n\nWhen you press any of the keys, \"b\", \"g\", \"r\", or \"w\", our function love.keypressed will be invoked and the variable pressed_key will be a string matching one of our letters.\nThis changes current_color, which is changing the color being drawn in love.draw.\nIn the next section, let's see how LÖVE handles the \"4. Tick time in game.\" step of the game loop.\nExercises\n\nTry adding a few more colors to the program. To understand how love.graphics.setColor works, see the documentation.\nMake is so that if the escape key is pressed, the function love.event.quit is invoked and the game exits. The string to use for the escape key can be found on the wiki's KeyConstant page.

Mapping","keywords":"","body":"Mapping\nLet's sidetrack from LÖVE for a minute to learn about a concept called maps.\nNot to be confused with overhead maps a player would walk around on in a game, but data maps.\nWe actually did mapping back in chapter 1 when we learned about tables.\ncoins = {\n  [\"half\"] = \"50 cents\",\n  [\"quarter\"] = \"25 cents\",\n  [\"dime\"] = \"10 cents\",\n  [\"nickel\"] = \"5 cents\",\n  [\"penny\"] = \"1 cent\"\n}\n\nprint(\"Which coin do you have?\")\nresponse = io.read()\n\nprint(\"Your coin is worth \" .. coins[response] .. \".\")\n\nWhenever the user typed in a coin, we mapped the coin name to a value by looking up the coin name in the table, or dictionary.\nSo what's the difference between tables, dictionaries, and maps?\n\ntables are just a data type in Lua that can be used to build data structures like lists and dictionaries\ndictionaries are key-value storages used to centralize similar-purpose data in one place and make it easier to look the data up\nmaps are data structures used to translate one type of information to another, and a dictionary is one type of map\n\nDictionaries are the only types of map we'll be concerned about here, but know that maps generally refer to instances of data structures that do mapping.\nThere are often discrepancies in terminology between mathematics and the various fields in computer science.\nDon't be surprised if you see dictionaries and maps being used synonymously in other contexts later in life.\nLet's do some mapping on our code we previously wrote to get a better feel for them.\nRemember all those if/elseif statements in main.lua?\n  if pressed_key == 'b' then\n    -- Blue\n    current_color = {0, 0, 1, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'g' then\n    -- Green\n    current_color = {0, 1, 0, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'r' then\n    -- Red\n    current_color = {1, 0, 0, 1}\n  elseif pressed_key == 'w' then\n    -- White\n    current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1}\n  end\n  if pressed_key == 'escape' then\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\n\nWe can put all that functionality in a map like this:\nlocal key_map = {\n  b = function()\n    current_color = {0, 0, 1, 1} -- Blue\n  end,\n  g = function()\n    current_color = {0, 1, 0, 1} -- Green\n  end,\n  r = function()\n    current_color = {1, 0, 0, 1} -- Red\n  end,\n  w = function()\n    current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1} -- White\n  end,\n  -- Close the game\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\n}\n\nThis doesn't look any more concise than our previous code, but our goal is to keep the love.keypressed function clean in this case.\nWhen a key is pressed it will be mapped to a key function we define in key_map.\nAnother important thing is these functions could be modular and moved anywhere we need them to be, and even re-used.\nLet's not go too crazy right now though.\nWe'll keep the key map somewhere near the top.\nlocal current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1}\nlocal seconds = 0\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  b = function()\n    current_color = {0, 0, 1, 1} -- Blue\n  end,\n  g = function()\n    current_color = {0, 1, 0, 1} -- Green\n  end,\n  r = function()\n    current_color = {1, 0, 0, 1} -- Red\n  end,\n  w = function()\n    current_color = {1, 1, 1, 1} -- White\n  end,\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local square = {100, 100, 100, 200, 200, 200, 200, 100}\n\n  -- Print a counter clock\n  local clock_display = 'Seconds: ' .. math.floor(seconds)\n  love.graphics.print(clock_display, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2)\n\n  -- Initialize the square with the default color (white)\n  love.graphics.setColor(current_color)\n  love.graphics.polygon('fill', square)\nend\n\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  -- Add up all the delta time as we get it\n  seconds = seconds + dt\nend\n\nIf you press a key that isn't part of the map then the new if statement (if key_map[pressed_key] ...) will see that key doesn't exist in the map and not do anything.\nkey_map[pressed_key]() is the same as saying key_map['b'](), key_map['escape']() or whatever the value of pressed_key was at the time.\n"},"pages/02-07-the-world.html":{"url":"pages/02-07-the-world.html","title":"2.7 - The world","keywords":"","body":"The world\nA world is a physical space where objects can be created (spawned) and interact.\nShapes and other things drawn on the screen are not implicitly part of a world and won't interact with each other unless they are.\nMultiple worlds can co-exist, but the objects in each world won't interact.\nGoing forward I will refer to these objects as entities.\nEntities\nEntities are made up of different components that allow them to interact.\nThese are the 3 fundamental physical components:\n\nshape - some sort of polygon to give our entity a physical shape that determines the boundaries of the entity\nbody - holds physical properties such as mass\nfixture - attaches a shape to a body\n\nLet's write a new main.lua from scratch and see how these are all wired up.\nFirst, a world needs to be defined:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 100)\n\nlove.physics.newWorld returns a table, an instance of a world.\nThe table holds functions that allow us to apply attributes to the world.\nIt also holds all the entities in our world, which is currently none on initialization.\nAccording to the documentation on love.physics.newWorld, our 1st and 2nd parameters set the X and Y gravity on our world.\nWe don't want any sideways gravity, but we'll go ahead and set an arbitrary number for the vertical gravity.\nWhile focusing on the world, we should allow the world to know whenever we get an update to the delta time.\nA world without time would be frozen;\nBy letting the world know about the passage of time, it can know whether it needs to make an entity fall another meter or two meters…\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world.update(world, dt)\nend\n\nActually, let's do one trick here.\nWhen calling a function in Lua and the first parameter of the function is the table the function is stored in, you can use a shortcut notation:\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world:update(dt)\nend\n\nAside from being easier to write, you'll see this way of invoking functions used all over the place in the LÖVE documentation.\nFinally, we'll add an entity to the game in 4 steps:\n\nCreate a table to store all the pieces of our entity together. Not entirely necessary but we'll learn later why this step makes things easier.\nCreate a body. This will be added to the entity table and the world.\nCreate the shape we want the entity to have.\nCreate a fixture to attach the body and shape together.\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first entity\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\n-- Give the triangle some weight\ntriangle.body:setMass(32)\ntriangle.shape =

triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nAfter creating the body table inside triangle, we called triangle.body.setMass to set a weight property on our triangle so it can fall.\nNotice we wrote triangle.body:setMass(32), which is the same as saying triangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32) but shorter and more conventional to the way the LÖVE documentation writes.\nWhat's going on inside love.draw looks pretty crazy so let's break the long line up.\n  love.graphics.polygon(\n    'line',\n    triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints())\n  )\n\nWe've used love.graphics.polygon previously so its purpose should already be familiar.\nThe first parameter 'line' is telling it that we want an outline of a shape drawn.\nThe second parameter is a table containing the points that need to be outlined.\nTo get the triangle's points we call triangle.shape:getPoints(), but this only returns the shape of the triangle and the relative position of the points.\nBy then calling triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()) we convert those relative points to their absolute position as that's what the polygon drawing function needs to know so it can draw the triangle exactly where it is supposed to be on the screen.\nLet's put it all together and add one more entity into the mix so the two can interact:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 100)\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first entity\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\n-- Give the triangle some

world:update(dt)\nend\n\nThis is a lot to digest so don't hesitate to re-read through this code several times if necessary.\nThere were a lot of new functions introduced in this section, so in the next section we'll take a deeper look at the documentation and read more about them and their components.\nExercises\n\nTry changing the mass (triangle.body:setMass) and gravity

documentation","keywords":"","body":"Reading documentation\nYou typically run into two types of documentation for software: guides and API documentation.\nGuides would be information on getting started, tutorials, and books.\nAn API (application programming interface) is a portion of software that a programmer writes for his/her program to allow fellow programmers to interact with their application.\nAs for LÖVE's programming interface, most of your interactions with the framework are done through the love global variable that the framework purposely exposes.\nAPI documentation is the most fundamental form of software documentation because without it, you would not know what all the functions in the program do unless you were resourceful enough to go in and study all the source code and figure each function out on your own.\nThe documentation for LÖVE (bookmark this!) is written in a wiki style where each table and function has an article that describes how to use it.\nFrom here you should see many modules listed.\nClick on love.physics.\nAgain, love.physics is just a table with functions in it.\nSo within the article we see each of the functions stored in it including the functions love.physics.newBody which we used to create our entities' bodies, love.physics.newPolygonShape which we used to create their shapes, and  love.physics.newFixture which we used to create their fixtures.\nWe also see love.physics.newWorld which created our world table.\nLet's look at the first function's article.\nClicking on the article for love.physics.newBody we get a synopsis showing how the function might be used, along with a description of its parameters and what the function returns.\nOver the course of different versions of the framework, functions may be modified so in the case of this function you can see examples of how to use it differently in different versions of LÖVE.\nSince the function lists that it returns a body, click the link to go over to the article on the body table's documentation.\nThere's a lot of functions here that set properties on the body and get properties from the body.\nOne of them is the body:setMass function we used to give our entity weight.\nWe can see that it takes one parameter and that the parameter is meant to simulate how many kilograms of mass the body has.\nWe originally told it that our triangle in the last section weighed 32 kilograms, which if you think the object fell too fast or too slow then you may need to adjust your world's gravity to match your expectation.\nNow let's go back to love.physics for a moment and take a look at one of the other components we added to our previous code, the fixture.\nWe previously created a fixture table by calling triangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape).\nHowever, we haven't seen any of these functions in the fixture table that could come in handy.\nFor instance, we could give our triangle bounciness by invoking fixture:setRestitution.\nOur triangle fixture is named triangle.fixture though, not fixture.\nIf 0 is no bounciness (default) and 1 is 100%, try modifying the game code and adding a restitution of 75%:\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\nTry running the game and see how that works.\nIf you set the restitution to 1 or higher then the triangle won't stop bouncing and will bounce itself right off the screen.\nCallbacks\nLet's backtrack now to the main article about the love table.\nIf you scroll down a little on the page, you'll see a section titled \"Callbacks\" that contains some functions we've become familiar with such as love.draw and love.update.\nThis is a list of all the functions in the game loop that we have and haven't talked about yet.\nA \"callback\" is a function you create and give to an API (the love table in this case) that will later get invoked as needed.\nCreating functions with these names allow you to tap into specific portions of the game loop and trigger your own events.\nLet's take a look at the love.keypressed callback for instance.\nIn the synopsis you see that it has 3 parameters (the documentation mistakenly calls parameters \"arguments\").\nWe used the first parameter key to see what key was pressed.\nIf you ever need to know what keys are available, you can click on the link provided next to the parameter name, KeyConstant to see a well-defined list of all the available key strings passed in to this parameter.\nThe second parameter scancode we didn't talk about, but it has a well-defined Scancode article explaining what it is.\nIf you are not familiar with scancodes, take a minute to read it and perhaps you'll learn about a feature you may want to use in your game.\nOne more callback we'll look at while we're here is love.focus.\nTake a moment to stop here and read what it does and what parameters it takes before continuing.\nNow it would be really cool if we were making a game and when the user switched to another application window, the game automatically paused for the user.\nSo first let's start by implementing a pause feature in our earlier game code:\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\n-- Triangle is the name of our first entity\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\n-- Give the triangle some weight\ntriangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32)\ntriangle.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(100, 100, 200, 100, 200, 200)\ntriangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape)\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\n-- Another entity\nlocal bar = {}\nbar.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 450, 'static')\nbar.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(0, 0, 0, 20, 400, 20, 400, 0)\nbar.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(bar.body, bar.shape)\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', bar.body:getWorldPoints(bar.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nNotice the 3 changes:\n\nWe added a boolean called paused and set it to false\nWe added a new function to key_map so that when \"space\" is pressed, the value of paused is set to not paused. not is an operator for booleans we previously didn't discuss. It simply says \"the opposite of this boolean\". So if paused is true, then setting paused to not paused will set it to false.\nLastly, inside love.update to told the world to update only if we are not paused. So the passage of time in the game world will cease when pressing the space key.\n\nExercises\n\nNow with the documentation in hand, define love.focus and make it so the game pauses when the user clicks away from the game window.\nBonus: make the game print a text saying that the game is paused when paused is true.

We require it, which invokes it and returns back whatever that file returns.\nIn this case is a table.\nNotice that when we pass in the filenames as arguments we just give the first part of the filename without the extension \".lua\" at the end.\nThis function expects that any file it is requiring is a Lua file.\nAfter we required the files, we printed the values of those variables, so you should see the results of the print statements appear in the console like before:\nfunction_module is      function: 0x40479548\ntable_module is table: 0x40479bc8\nWe pulled in the return values from the other two files into our main.lua file and printed the values, but since we didn't invoke the functions from those two files then we got a blank game window when running the program.\nLet's define a love.draw in main.lua like before and invoke the functions we got back from both modules:\nlocal function_module = require('function-module')\nlocal table_module = require('table-module')\n\nprint('function_module is', function_module)\nprint('table_module is', table_module)\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  function_module()\n  table_module.print_stuff()\nend\n\nWe were able to invoke the functions and use the returned data as if it were all in the same file.\nOrganizing modules\nIt may help to see a real example of using modules in a game, so let's take our previous game code from 2.8 - Reading documentation and see how we can separate out functionality.\nThe first thing we did in our game was define a world, so let's start by putting our world-related code in a dedicated file named world.lua:\n-- world.lua\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\nreturn world\n\nRemember that you need the return statement at the end of your files or else the code will return nil when you go to require it and this could cause all kinds of unexepcted errors when you run it.\nNext let's create a folder named entities that we can keep all our game entities in.\nWe plan on creating more entities so it will help to keep them all together.\nIn the entities folder, create a file and name it triangle.lua.\nWe'll cut all the code from the original main.lua that related to our triangle entity and put it here:\n-- entities/triangle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal triangle = {}\ntriangle.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\ntriangle.body.setMass(triangle.body, 32)\ntriangle.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(100, 100, 200, 100, 200, 200)\ntriangle.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(triangle.body, triangle.shape)\ntriangle.fixture:setRestitution(0.75)\n\nreturn triangle\n\nNotice how we are requiring the world table from world.lua, because we need to access that table in this entity's file so we can add the entity to the world.\nWe also need to do the same thing as above with the bar entity:\n-- entities/bar.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal bar = {}\nbar.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 450, 'static')\nbar.shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(0, 0, 0, 20, 400, 20, 400, 0)\nbar.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(bar.body, bar.shape)\n\nreturn bar\n\nNow our main.lua should only contain our key map and love functions:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal bar = require('entities/bar')\nlocal triangle = require('entities/triangle')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', triangle.body:getWorldPoints(triangle.shape:getPoints()))\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', bar.body:getWorldPoints(bar.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  world:update(dt)\nend\n\nOur two entities and world get pulled into main.lua and everything should run exactly as before.\nOne thing to note is that even though we require world.lua 3 times in our code, it is the same world and not 3 copies.\nThis is because Lua knows to only run a module the first time you require it and not invoke it again.\nOnce it runs the first time, the returned results are stored in memory for the next time you try to require it.\nWe can prove this by adding a print statement to world.lua:\n-- world.lua\n\nprint(\"This is the world\")\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 9.81 * 128)\n\nreturn world\n\nHow many times does \"This is the world\" get printed to the console?\nExercises\n\nTry creating two new modules; One that returns a string and one that returns a number.\n\n"},"pages/02-10-collision-callbacks.html":{"url":"pages/02-10-collision-callbacks.html","title":"2.10 - Collision callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Collision callbacks\nWhen writing a game such as a platformer you may want something special to happen when two objects collide.\nIf it's a powerup, for instance, you may want the powerup to despawn (be removed from the world) if a player touches it and then give the player a special ability (think Mario and mushrooms).\nIf a player and an enemy bump into each other, you may want the player's health to decrement.\nThe world table has a method that allows you to program in functionality like this for when two entities collide.\nIt does this by allowing you to create callbacks as we learned before, but these callbacks are triggered before, during, or after collision.\nTake a look at World:setCallbacks.\nIf you look at the parameters for World:setCallbacks, you see it can take four functions.\nThe description of these parameters helps explain when the functions will be called.\nbeginContact and endContact should be self explanatory; They happen at the point where contact begins and ends in a collision, but preSolve and postSolve may not be as obvious.\nNonetheless, let's edit the previously-created world.lua file and write some collision callbacks to test this functionality.\n-- world.lua\n\nlocal begin_contact_counter = 0\nlocal end_contact_counter = 0\nlocal pre_solve_counter = 0\nlocal post_solve_counter = 0\n\nlocal begin_contact_callback = function()\n  begin_contact_counter = begin_contact_counter + 1\n  print('beginContact called ' .. begin_contact_counter ..

Parameters:\n-- {fixture} fixture_a - first fixture object in the collision.\n-- {fixture} fixture_b - second fixture object in the collision.\n-- {contact} contact - world object created on and at the point of\n--   contact.

Let's create new entities to represent the ball and paddle:\n-- entities/ball.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic')\nentity.body:setMass(32)\nentity.body:setLinearVelocity(300, 300)\nentity.shape = love.physics.newCircleShape(0, 0, 10)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setRestitution(1)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 560, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(180, 20)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nBefore we try and run anything, take a look at a few things we've done differently in defining these entities than we've previously done.\n\nIn ball.lua we are defining a circle shape instead of a polygon. This means we have no sides or corner points we can reference when spawning or tracking the position of this object. Circles have to be tracked from their center point and their boundaries by their radius.\nIn this file we're using Body:setLinearVelocity to apply movement on the ball in a specific direction when the entity spawns.\nIn paddle.lua we are defining a polygon shape, but instead of specifying each point we are using the love.physics.newRectangleShape function to define the shape. This will still generate a polygon as before, but instead of specifying each point in the shape we are giving a height and width and allowing it to figure out the shape we want based on those two parameters. Think of it as a shortcut version of the love.physics.newPolygonShape function.\nThe paddle has a static body while the ball is dynamic. What this entails is the ball will be affected by the paddle but the paddle won't be affected by the ball. Even though the paddle is static, it can be manually repositioned as we'll do later with buttons.\nIn both entity files, we are passing the full entity table as the fixture user data instead of just a string name like before. This will allow us to easily access the entire entity inside the collision callback as we'll see later. You'll want to go back and compare that code from the Collision Callbacks section to these entities, but don't worry if it doesn't make complete sense yet.\n\nNow we need to modify main.lua to load up our new entities:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon(\n    'line',\n    paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints())\n  )\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nTake note of a few things we're doing here:\n\nFor drawing the circle, we need to invoke love.graphics.circle.\nFor drawing the paddle, we still invoke love.graphics.polygon as the rectangle is still a polygon shape.\n\nNow let's remove any print statements in world.lua just to clean things up.\nWe'll leave the callbacks there since we may use them later but we'll leave them empty for now.\nWe'll also set the gravity to 0 because we want the ball to bounce freely like in the real Breakout game and not lose any momentum.\n-- world.lua\n\n-- Called at the beginning of any contact in the world.

moving off screen.\nPossibly the most simple approach is to put up some walls.\nCan you guess what the code to those walls may look like?\nYup, they will be entities similar to the paddle except that they just sit at the edges of the screen.\nLet's create some entities for that purpose:\n-- entities/boundary-top.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 5, 'static')\nentity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(800, 10)\nentity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\nentity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\nreturn entity\n\nTake a look at these numbers for a minute.\nFor the location of the body we specified 400 pixels.\nSo starting from the top left corner and moving right along the x-axis we've specified the very center of an 800-pixel-wide window.\nThe reason we've done this is because we want the top and bottom wall boundaries to stretch 800 pixels wide, the entire length of the window, and when calling newBody and spawning an entity's body it will spawn the center point of the entity shape at that location.\nNot all entity shapes are square, or even polygonal, so it is simplest for the game engine to center the shape on the body's spawn point rather than using another point of reference on the shape, like the top left corner of the shape (not all shapes have corners).\nIn fact, the ball and paddle spawned centered on the location we gave for their bodies.\nSo we made the walls 800 pixels wide and just to give it a little visibility we made them 10 pixels tall.\nYou would think we'd spawn the wall at the very top of the screen (0 pixels on the y-axis,) but since our walls will be centered to the spawn points we should move down half the height of the wall if we want it all to appear on screen.\nNow the boundary on the bottom will have the same dimensions, but it will be spawned at the bottom of the screen (600 pixels) minus half the height of the wall (5 pixels):\n-- entities/boundary-bottom.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlocal entity = {}\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 595,

completed source code for this section:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-1\nLooking back at our list of minimal requirements we've already completed one thing on our list:\n\nThe ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\n\nThere's still quite a bit more work to complete this list so let's continue in the next section.\nExercises\n\nMaybe it would be better if the boundary lines were even with the screen so we couldn't see them. Modify the boundary positions so it looks like the ball is bouncing off the edge of the screen.\nWhat happens if we require the boundaries but don't draw them in love.draw? Does the game still work?\n\n"},"pages/02-12-breakout-part-2.html":{"url":"pages/02-12-breakout-part-2.html","title":"2.12 - Breakout (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"Breakout (part 2): entity management\nReview\nIn the previous section we made a checklist of requirements and accomplished one of them:\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen\nThe player controls a \"paddle\" entity that hits a ball\nThe ball destroys the bricks\n✔ The ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\nIf the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends\n\nIn the previous exercise, the goal was to move the boundaries so they were just off screen.\nThis gives the effect that the ball is bouncing off the edges of the game window.\n-- entities/boundary-bottom.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, 606, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-left.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, -6, 300, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-right.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 806, 300, 'static')\n\n-- entities/boundary-top.lua\nentity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 400, -6, 'static')\n\nHere they have been moved 6 pixels off screen just to use even numbers and make calculation easier.\nPreviously we also raised the question of whether or not the boundaries would work if we still require'd them in main.lua but didn't draw them in love.draw.\nThe answer is they still work but we don't see them.\nSince they are off screen, that doesn't matter anyway and we can save our program from doing extra work:\n-- main.lua\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints()))\nend\n\nEntity list\nLet's think about the problem of brick entities for a minute.\nWe could create an entity file for each brick, but they are more or less the same except that they spawn in different spots.\nImagine making 50 different entity files and then inside love.draw making 50 lines to draw each brick and so on.\nWhat we can instead do is make an entity file for 1 brick then make a list with 50 copies of it (or however many brick copies we end up fitting on the screen).\nWe can then loop over this list to draw the bricks.\nLet's first create the brick entity file:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nInstead of returning an entity in this file, we returned a function that takes an x-position and y-position as parameters.\nWhen the function gets invoked wherever it is required, it will generate a new entity with those coordinates for its spawn point.\nHere's how we can use it:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nlocal entities = {\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  local ball_x, ball_y = ball.body:getWorldCenter()\n  love.graphics.circle('fill', ball_x, ball_y, ball.shape:getRadius())\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', paddle.body:getWorldPoints(paddle.shape:getPoints()))\n\n  for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n    love.graphics.polygon('fill', entity.body:getWorldPoints(entity.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nWe made an entity table with a list of brick entities in it, then in love.draw we made a for loop to draw each entity in the list.\nBefore we change anything else try running the game and taking a look that the bricks appear and that everything works.\nRule of single responsibility\nOur goal for the rest of this section will be to simplify entity management.\nOne strategy we'll have for doing this is to think of each file in our game as having a single responsibility.\nA good sign that we're doing this is main.lua is very small and easy to scan over with the eyes and digest.\nSo what is the responsibility of main.lua?\n\nCreate the callback functions necessary to run the game.\n\nHere's some things it is doing that don't fit that responsibility:\n\nLoad and store all the entities\nFigure out how to draw each type of entity in love.draw\nStore a map of keypresses\n\nImagine our game is an organization and each file is a role in the company.\nOur main file is like the secretary that knows how to handle requests from outsiders.\nIf somebody called asking the secretary about building-maintenance issues, the secretary wouldn't grab plumbing tools and take care of the problem but rather dispatch the person whose responsibility is that exact kind of problem.\nAs the owner of this organization we should know everyone's roles so it's easy to know where each responsibility lies.\nIt will make it easier for us to grow the company to the size we desire.\nOne easy improvement is to not write out all the instructions for drawing each entity within the main file, but rather let each entity file be responsible for every feature of that entity, including how to draw that entity.\nWe may want to get fancy later and draw bricks in different colors, for instance.\nThat could get complicated and we don't want the main file to retain a bunch of code about brick colors and such.\nModifying the entities is as easy as creating draw functions in the entity tables:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    love.graphics.polygon('fill', self.body:getWorldPoints(self.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(pos_x, pos_y)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, pos_x, pos_y, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(180, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    love.graphics.polygon('line', self.body:getWorldPoints(self.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\n-- entities/ball.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'dynamic')\n  entity.body:setMass(32)\n  entity.body:setLinearVelocity(300, 300)\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newCircleShape(0, 0, 10)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setRestitution(1)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    local self_x, self_y = self.body:getWorldCenter()\n    love.graphics.circle('fill', self_x, self_y, self.shape:getRadius())\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nGo ahead and make all the entities return a function with x_pos and y_pos parameters and we'll just add everything to the entity list like the bricks.\nDon't forget to change out the numbers in the love.physics.newBody(world, 200, 200, 'dynamic') with the arguments being passed in by the function: love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'dynamic').\nFor the boundaries entity files there is no need for entity.draw functions, but still make them return functions with the two parameters.\nNow update the entities list in main.lua to include all the entities:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nlocal entities = {\n  boundary_bottom(400, 606),\n  boundary_left(-6, 300),\n  boundary_right(806, 300),\n  boundary_top(400, -6),\n  paddle(300, 500),\n  ball(200, 200),\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\n-- Boolean to keep track of whether our game is paused or not\nlocal paused = false\n\nlocal key_map = {\n  escape = function()\n    love.event.quit()\n  end,\n  space = function()\n    paused = not paused\n  end\n}\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n    if entity.draw then entity:draw() end\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    paused = true\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  -- Check in the key map if there is a function\n  -- that matches this pressed key's name\n  if key_map[pressed_key] then\n    key_map[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not paused then\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nTake a look at our love.draw function.\nIt is much simpler now that it no longer needs to know how to draw each entity.\nIt just asks the entity if it knows how to draw itself and if it does it tells it to do so.\nRemember that invoking entity:draw() is just shorthand for writing entity.draw(entity) because of the :.\nOk, but putting the entities in a list didn't clean up this file.\nNow this file is responsible for knowing where to spawn the entities and having them in a list just makes this file bigger.\nWell you see the reason we put them in a list is because we want to make a new game file called entities.lua that will be responsible for loading, spawning, and storing all the entities when the game starts up.\nCreate a new file then cut all the entity require statements and the entity list and paste it in the new file:\n-- entities.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_left = require('entities/boundary-left')\nlocal boundary_right = require('entities/boundary-right')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nreturn {\n  boundary_bottom(400, 606),\n  boundary_left(-6, 300),\n  boundary_right(806, 300),\n  boundary_top(400, -6),\n  paddle(300, 500),\n  ball(200, 200),\n  brick(100, 100),\n  brick(200, 100),\n  brick(300, 100)\n}\n\nAnd now the top of our main file only needs to load the entities file and it will have the list to use in love.draw and elsewhere as needed:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal entities = require('entities')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nWhen you run the game, you should be seeing something similar to this:\n\nIf you missed anything or are having issues, here's a copy of the completed source code for this section:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-2\nAnd that's about it for entity management.\nWe'll figure out how to handle keypresses for the paddle and everything else in the next section.\nWe'll finish the cleanup in our main file while we're at it.\nExercises\n\nNow that our entities have passed off knowledge on where they spawn over to entities.lua, our left and right boundaries are identical files. Replace boundary-left.lua and boundary-right.lua with a single boundary-vertical.lua file and spawn two copies of that in entities.lua. If you get stuck, check out the entities.lua file in the next section for how this is done.\n\n"},"pages/02-13-breakout-part-3.html":{"url":"pages/02-13-breakout-part-3.html","title":"2.13 - Breakout (part 3)","keywords":"","body":"Breakout (part 3): inputs\nReview\nIn the previous section we reconstructed our entities to make room for bricks and additional functionality.\nWe haven't completed any new items on our checklist:\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen\nThe player controls a \"paddle\" entity that hits a ball\nThe ball destroys the bricks\n✔ The ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\nIf the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends\n\nSo let's come up with a system to handle user input and get the paddle moving.\nInput service\nInside main.lua there is some functionality for this that we are going to remove and rewrite starting with a new file that specifically handles all the user input.\nThis kind of file is typically called a service because it abstracts away tedious functionality into an easy-to-use service.\nI encourage you to write out the service instead of copying and pasting.\nRead through each function and try to understand what each one does.\n-- input.lua\n\n-- This table is the service and will contain some functions\n-- that can be accessed from entities or the main.lua.\nlocal input = {}\n-- Map specific user inputs to game actions\nlocal press_functions = {}\nlocal release_functions = {}\n\n\n-- For moving paddle left\ninput.left = false\n-- For moving paddle right\ninput.right = false\n-- Keep track of whether game is pause\ninput.paused = false\n-- Look up in the map for actions that correspond to specific key presses\ninput.press = function(pressed_key)\n  if press_functions[pressed_key] then\n    press_functions[pressed_key]()\n  end\nend\n-- Look up in the map for actions that correspond to specific key releases\ninput.release = function(released_key)\n  if release_functions[released_key] then\n    release_functions[released_key]()\n  end\nend\n-- Handle window focusing/unfocusing\ninput.toggle_focus = function(focused)\n  if not focused then\n    input.paused = true\n  end\nend\n\n\npress_functions.left = function()\n  input.left = true\nend\npress_functions.right = function()\n  input.right = true\nend\npress_functions.escape = function()\n  love.event.quit()\nend\npress_functions.space = function()\n  input.paused = not input.paused\nend\n\n\nrelease_functions.left = function()\n  input.left = false\nend\nrelease_functions.right = function()\n  input.right = false\nend\n\n\nreturn input\n\nThe input table is what gets returned, meaning when we require('input') in another file, we get back that table and its contents.\nInside the input there are three boolean properties that get toggled by user input: input.left, input.right, and input.paused.\nAlong with these three properties, there are three functions exposed to us to make use of: input.press, input.release, and input.toggle_focus, all of which we will invoke from our callbacks in main.lua:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal entities = require('entities')\nlocal input = require('input')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n    if entity.draw then entity:draw() end\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  input.toggle_focus(focused)\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  input.press(pressed_key)\nend\n\nlove.keyreleased = function(released_key)\n  input.release(released_key)\nend\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not input.paused then\n    for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n      if entity.update then entity:update(dt) end\n    end\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nIn love.update we skip updates if input.paused is true.\nHowever if the game is not paused then it will loop through the entity list, calling entity.update if the entity has an update function.\nWith this added functionality, we can append an entity.update function into our existing paddle code:\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nentity.update = function(self)\n  -- Don't move if both keys are pressed. Just return\n  -- instead of going through the rest of the function.\n  if input.left and input.right then\n    return\n  end\n  local self_x, self_y = self.body:getPosition()\n  if input.left then\n    self.body:setPosition(self_x - 10, self_y)\n  elseif input.right then\n    self.body:setPosition(self_x + 10, self_y)\n  end\nend\n\nThe left and right arrows will now move the paddle!\nThere isn't much else to say here in the way of input.\nA bit unrelated to the actual input, but more so the paddle functionality is it moves off screen and doesn't adhere to the boundaries?\nWhy is that?\nIf you remember when we created the paddle, it is a static entity.\nIt doesn't have the ability to move on its own or by the effect of other entities.\nThis will cause us some problems later (and we're learning the hard way)!\nRather than forcing the paddle with an invisible push, we force a new position for the paddle when we call body:setPosition inside the paddle's entity.update function.\nIt's like we're teleporting it on top of whatever space we want with a keystroke, ignoring all physics and collision.\nThis is simpler to code and gets around the fact the paddle's static body won't respond to force.\nTo fix this, we can artificially set the boundary on the paddle by checking if it is out of bounds before moving it.\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nentity.update = function(self)\n  -- Don't move if both keys are pressed. Just return\n  -- instead of going through the rest of the function.\n  if input.left and input.right then\n    return\n  end\n  local self_x, self_y = self.body:getPosition()\n  if input.left then\n    local new_x = math.max(self_x - 10, 108)\n    self.body:setPosition(new_x, self_y)\n  elseif input.right then\n    local new_x = math.min(self_x + 10, 700)\n    self.body:setPosition(new_x, self_y)\n  end\nend\n\nCalling math.max means we will set the new x-position to either self_x - 10 or 100, whichever number is bigger.\nThis prevents us from getting a number so small it runs off too far to the left.\nmath.min does the opposite and takes care of the right side of the screen.\nOne issue you may or may not notice is movement isn't always a uniform speed, and depending on the speed of your computer the paddle may appear to go faster or slower.\nRemember the article on delta time?\nWe need to scale the distance travelled to match the amount of time that has passed.\nConveniently, we are getting the delta time from love.update already.\nTake a closer look at it:\n-- main.lua\n\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not input.paused then\n    for _, entity in ipairs(entities) do\n      -- Delta time is being passed\n      -- to the entity.update function here\n      --                                  |\n      --                                  |\n      --                                  V\n      if entity.update then entity:update(dt) end\n    end\n    world:update(dt)\n  end\nend\n\nWhich means we can do this:\n-- entities/paddle.lua\n\nentity.update = function(self, dt)\n  -- Don't move if both keys are pressed.

This is due to friction. How can that be fixed?\nWhen the game is paused, make it display text on the screen so the player knows the game isn't just frozen.

We'll just call it entity.health.\nUpdate main.lua to remove/destroy any entities that have no more health\n\nFirst the world:\n-- world.lua\n\n-- Called at the end of any contact in the world. Parameters:\n-- {fixture} fixture_a - first fixture object in the collision.\n-- {fixture} fixture_b - second fixture object in the collision.\n-- {contact} contact - world object created on and at the point of contact\n--   See further: https://love2d.org/wiki/Contact\nlocal end_contact_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b, contact)\n  local entity_a = fixture_a:getUserData()\n  local entity_b = fixture_b:getUserData()\n  if entity_a.end_contact then entity_a:end_contact() end\n  if entity_b.end_contact then entity_b:end_contact() end\nend\n\nlocal world = love.physics.newWorld(0, 0)\n\nworld:setCallbacks(nil, end_contact_callback, nil, nil)\n\nreturn world\n\nThe only callback we'll be using for this tutorial is the end-contact callback, so for world:setCallbacks we are going to returning nil for the rest to keep our code fast and clean.\nTake a look at what is happening inside end_contact_callback.\nRemember inside each entity when we invoked entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)?\nWith the entity attached to each fixture, we can get access to those entities by invoking fixture:getUserData in the callback above.\nOnce we have access to each entity, we check to see if the entity has any end_contact functions, code specific to that entity that needs to run when ending the collision.\nNow we can go to brick.lua and define that functionality:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  -- How many times the brick can be hit before it is destroyed\n  entity.health = 2\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    love.graphics.polygon('fill', self.body:getWorldPoints(self.shape:getPoints()))\n  end\n\n  entity.end_contact = function(self)\n    self.health = self.health - 1\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nNotice the two new values in the table, entity.health and entity.end_contact.\nInside end_contact we are subtracting 1 health when the collision ends.\nHealth could start at any number and that means the ball will need to collide with the brick that many times before the health reaches 0.\nLastly, we need to go into main.lua and adjust love.update so it does something when it sees an entity with 0 health:\n-- main.lua\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if not input.paused then\n    local index = 1\n    while index \nThe entity is removed from entities as well as having its fixture destroyed from the world.\nThis will only happen to bricks with 0 health.\nIt won't happen to entities where we didn't define health because nil is not the same thing as 0.\nNotice that a while loop was used here.\nThis is because we may remove entities from the list we are looping over and this would throw off the index count for a regular for loop.\nIf you missed anything or are having issues, here's a copy of the completed source code for this section:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-4\nIn the next section we'll review the checklist and see what is left to cover.\nExercises\n\nIt would be great if the colors of the bricks changed depending how much health the brick has. Update the brick's entity.draw function with some colors. Hint: we covered colors in 2.4 - Game loop.\nAdd more bricks to the screen. What's the easiest way to do that?\n\n"},"pages/02-15-breakout-part-5.html":{"url":"pages/02-15-breakout-part-5.html","title":"2.15 - Breakout (part 5)","keywords":"","body":"Breakout (part 5): game state\nReview\nWe've gotten a bit done so let's look at the basic requirements again:\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen\n✔ The player controls a \"paddle\" entity that hits a ball\n✔ The ball destroys the bricks\n✔ The ball needs to stay within the boundaries of the screen\nIf the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends\n\nIn the previous exercise the question was brought up what would be the easiest way to draw a bunch of bricks across the screen.\nA simple, but very tedious answer to that would be to position the bricks one at a time in entities.lua like so:\n  brick(40, 80),\n  brick(100, 140)\n  -- and so on...\n\nIf you want to make your bricks into a shape or sculpture then that might be the best approach.\nIf you just want to arrange your bricks into a grid, then the easiest way would be to write a numeric for-loop.\n-- entities.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_vertical = require('entities/boundary-vertical')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal pause_text = require('entities/pause-text')\nlocal ball = require('entities/ball')\nlocal brick = require('entities/brick')\n\nlocal entities = {\n  boundary_bottom(400, 606),\n  boundary_vertical(-6, 300),\n  boundary_vertical(806, 300),\n  boundary_top(400, -6),\n  paddle(300, 500),\n  pause_text(),\n  ball(200, 200)\n}\n\nlocal row_width = love.window.getMode() -

Interactive coding statements are processed from the inner parenthesis and worked outwards.\nSo why the long calculation?\nLet's start off with a simpler calculation:\n  local brick_x = number * 60\n\nStarting with the number 0 up to 38, there will be 39 loops and therefore 39 bricks drawn.\nOn the first loop, number is 0.\nSince the bricks are 50 pixels wide this would draw the bricks with a 10 pixel space between each.\nFirst brick at 60, then 120, then 180...\nOk, but then after only a dozen bricks we would start running off the screen.\nThis is where the modulus comes in handy:\n  local brick_x = (number * 60) % row_width\n\nrow_width is how wide we want a row of bricks to be be.\nIn this case row_width is the screen width, 800 pixels, subtract 20 pixels for padding.\nSo draw the bricks every 60 pixels, but then when you get to 780 pixels, start back at 0 pixels and begin drawing a new row.\nThanks modulus!\nNow just to give the bricks some spacing on the left side away from the wall, we can go ahead and add 40 pixels to the final result for the x-position:\n  local brick_x = ((number * 60) % row_width) + 40\n\nThe brick's y-position is calculated a little bit differently.\nWhat we need to find out is which row we're on so we know where on the y-axis to draw.\nIf we take the number and multiply it by 60 then do a modulus we know that gives us the x-position.\nSo let's take that chunk of code from above and make that the basis of our y-position calculation:\n  local brick_y = (number * 60) % row_width\n\nRather than using modulus, if we use regular division we get a small remainder every time (number * 60) exceeds the row width:\n  local brick_y = (number * 60) / row_width\n\nThis will give us a number with decimals so to keep things rounded we can use math.floor to snap the y-position  down to the nearest whole number:\n  local brick_y = math.floor((number * 60) / row_width)\n\nGreat!\nNow every time the x-position exceeds the row width, we get back the number of the row we're on... 0 for the first, 1 for the second, 2 and so on.\nWith this number we can now space out each row by 40 pixels:\n  local brick_y = math.floor((number * 60) / row_width) * 40\n\nThen finally just to shift the bricks a little further down the screen we give it a padding that looks right, say 80:\n  local brick_y = (math.floor((number * 60) / row_width) * 40) + 80\n\nAnd there you go.\nThe entity can just be added to the end of the entities list so it doesn't get lost:\n  entities[#entities + 1] = brick(brick_x, brick_y)\n\nIn the previous exercises we also talked about drawing the bricks different colors to indicate their integrity/health left before they will be destroyed.\nRather than review that now, let's dive into state management and we'll wrap coloring up along the way.\nState management\nYour average, every-day program has a lot of information it needs to story in memory.\nFor our game to function with just the basic features, we need to store information about each entity, whether or not the game is currently paused, or if the game is won or lost.\nThis information is called the state.\nThe state is data that may change during the lifetime of the application.\nThink of the state of your lights in your room.\nAre they currently in an \"on\" or \"off\" state?\nThe state can cause different effects on the application, like if the \"pause\" state of the game is \"true\" then the world will no longer receive updates.\nOne thing we must think of is how to organize the state of our application.\nThis is something we take for granted often in the real world;\nWe don't have to figure out where to store the state of our lights.\nIt's a piece of information intrinsic to the lamp's design.\nSo why do we have to care so much about our game's state?\nTo be fair, our game is small so we probably don't need to.\nHowever, it is crucial to reconcile such things while applications are small because it will be very difficult to go back and fix a bunch of code once the application is big.\nThe way you should organize the state of your application should accomplish a few things:\n\nIt should be easy to find and access the necessary data that makes up the state. For instance, how easy is it for our main file to access the entities and loop over them in the love.update function?\nThere should only be one copy of the state. If we want to access the \"paused\" state of our game in multiple places that is fine, but we shouldn't have multiple \"paused\" variables floating around our game. If we had a \"paused\" variable inside an entity file and another inside the input service updating independently then they could get out of sync and our game would get confused on when it should be paused.\nThe state should only be accessed where it is needed. If you were accessing or storing the \"paused\" state inside the ball entity, then if that ball was destroyed then something bad will happen the next time the game checks to see if it is paused.\n\nWhat files contain the state of our game?\n\nentities.lua - Each entity table is responsible for its own state. For instance, each brick stores the state of its own health. All the entities tables are generated and stored here. The entities are not stored in the entities folder. Those are just functions used to generate the entities. The blueprints.\ninput.lua - This file is responsible for capturing user input, but also storing the state of what keys are currently being pressed.\nworld.lua - This file is not only the blueprints for the game world, but it also stores the world instance that is generated when the game starts. We made the world instance easily accessible to the rest of the application by writing return world at the end. There would be no game if this wasn't easily accessible.\n\nA few pieces of game state we need to add are a boolean of whether the game is over, another for if the stage is cleared, and also a list of colors to use in our game which we'll refer to as our palette.\nThis information wouldn't really fit in any of the places we listed above, and we don't want to add it to main.lua because of our first rule that the game state should be easy to access where it is needed.\nBesides, that's not the main file's responsibility.\nWe'll go ahead and just make a new file called state.lua and store the overall game state in this file.\nThis is also a little matter of opinion but the \"paused\" and button states we'll also move in here since they affect the overall game's state.\nThis will also make it so that input.lua's only responsibility is to capture and translate the user input, not to handle any state whatsoever.\n-- state.lua\n\n-- The state of the game. This way our data is separate from our functionality.\n\nreturn {\n  button_left = false,\n  button_right = false,\n  game_over = false,\n  palette = {\n    {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0},  -- red\n    {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0},  -- green\n    {0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0},  -- blue\n    {0.9, 1.0, 0.2, 1.0},  -- yellow\n    {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}   -- white\n  },\n  paused = false,\n  stage_cleared = false\n}\n\nIt's kind of a nice feeling to keep all the state together.\nWe could even move the entities list into state.lua and get rid of entities.lua, but this doesn't seem necessary.\nNow with this shift in data we need to update input.lua and main.lua to reference the new file:\n-- input.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\n\n-- Map specific user inputs to game states\nlocal press_functions = {\n  left =

end,\n  right = function()\n    state.button_right = false\n  end\n}\n\n\n-- This table is the service and will contain some functions\n-- that can be accessed from entities or the main.lua.\nreturn {\n  -- Look up in the map for actions that correspond to specific key presses\n  press = function(pressed_key)\n    if press_functions[pressed_key] then\n      press_functions[pressed_key]()\n

in ipairs(entities) do\n    if entity.draw then entity:draw() end\n  end\nend\n\nlove.focus = function(focused)\n  input.toggle_focus(focused)\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n

state.stage_cleared then\n    return\n  end\n\n  local index = 1\n  while index \nNotice the change to love.update.\nWe check if state.game_over, state.paused or state.stage_cleared is true and if so, we return from love.update without doing any of the updates as these kind of game states merit freezing the screen.\nNext up, update paddle.lua to require state instead of input.\nThe entity.update function now needs to reference state.button_left and state.button_right to tell if the player has pressed any buttons.\nTry updating it on your own.\nIf you do get stuck, the source code will be in the link at the bottom waiting for you.\nOk, now that we have a state where we stored the colors it is probably a good time to try and update brick.lua.\nFirst let's look at those colors stored in state.lua:\n  palette = {\n    {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0},  -- red\n    {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0},  -- green\n    {0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0},  -- blue\n    {0.9, 1.0, 0.2, 1.0},  -- yellow\n    {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}   -- white\n  },\n\nThe palette table is a list of more tables.\nEach table in the list represents colors where the first number is the amount of red, 2nd the amount of green, 3rd the amount of blue, and 4th number the amount of opacity.\nSetting the last number to 0 means the color is 100% transparent and 1 means it is completely opaque.\nAll of these values mix together to form a single color.\nIn the case of the first color, we have the red value set to maximum opaque red with no other colors mixed in.\nI would encourage you to go back and edit the colors in this palette after everything is working.\nNow, inside brick.lua let's update entity.draw:\n-- entities/brick.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(50, 20)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body,

default color (white)\n    love.graphics.setColor(state.palette[5])\n  end\n\n  entity.end_contact = function(self)\n    self.health = self.health - 1\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nBefore drawing the brick's polygon, we set the graphics renderer to use one of the colors from state.palette.\nThe color to use depends on what the brick's health is.\nSo if the brick has 2 health then state.palette[self.health] will become state.palette[2] which will grab the 2nd color in the list... green.\nIf the brick's health was 1, then the first color from the palette would be selected... red.\nAfter the colored polygon is drawn, entity.draw finishes up by setting the renderer color back to white.\nIf we didn't do this step, the ball and paddle would get drawn the same color as the bricks.\nOne last thing we need to do to get the game working is update pause-text.lua as it is incorrectly looking for the \"pause\" state in input.lua instead of the new state.lua location:\n-- entities/pause-text.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\n\nreturn function()\n  local window_width, window_height = love.window.getMode()\n\n  local entity = {}\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n

     2\n      )\n    end\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nFinal touches\nWe need the game to end when the player destroys all the bricks or loses the ball.\nJust like the pause-text entity, display some messages based on the game state.\n-- entities/game-over-text.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\n\nreturn function()\n  local window_width, window_height = love.window.getMode()\n\n  local entity = {}\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    if state.game_over then\n      love.graphics.print(\n        {state.palette[5], 'GAME OVER'},\n        math.floor(window_width / 2) - 100,\n        math.floor(window_height / 2),\n        0,\n        2,\n        2\n      )\n    end\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\n-- entities/stage-clear-text.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\n\nreturn function()\n  local window_width, window_height = love.window.getMode()\n\n  local entity = {}\n\n  entity.draw = function(self)\n    if state.stage_cleared then\n      love.graphics.print(\n

entity\nend\n\nTo trigger the \"GAME OVER\" text is easy enough.\nWe need to add a collision callback to boundary-bottom.lua to set the game's state.game_over to true on any collision:\n-- entities/boundary-bottom.lua\n\nlocal state = require('state')\nlocal world = require('world')\n\nreturn function(x_pos, y_pos)\n  local entity = {}\n  entity.body = love.physics.newBody(world, x_pos, y_pos, 'static')\n  entity.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(800, 10)\n  entity.fixture = love.physics.newFixture(entity.body, entity.shape)\n  entity.fixture:setUserData(entity)\n\n  entity.end_contact = function(self)\n    state.game_over = true\n  end\n\n  return entity\nend\n\nDon't forget we need to update entities.lua to add our two new entities:\n-- entities.lua\n\nlocal boundary_bottom = require('entities/boundary-bottom')\nlocal boundary_vertical = require('entities/boundary-vertical')\nlocal boundary_top = require('entities/boundary-top')\nlocal paddle = require('entities/paddle')\nlocal game_over_text = require('entities/game-over-text')\nlocal pause_text = require('entities/pause-text')\nlocal stage_clear_text =

love.window.getMode() - 20\nfor number = 0, 38 do\n  local brick_x = ((number * 60) % row_width) + 40\n  local brick_y = (math.floor((number * 60) / row_width) * 40) + 80\n  entities[#entities + 1] = brick(brick_x, brick_y)\nend\n\nreturn entities\n\nOk, test that out and check that the \"GAME OVER\" text works.\nIf it does, then let's continue on and add the conditions for how to win the game.\nThis involves checking through all the entities in love.update to make sure we still have bricks.\nIf we don't have any bricks left, then the player destroyed them all and the stage is cleared.\n-- main.lua\nlove.update = function(dt)\n  if state.game_over or state.paused or state.stage_cleared then\n    return\n  end\n\n  -- Switch to true if we have bricks left\n  local have_bricks = false\n\n  local index = 1\n  while index \nEvery time love.update is ran, we set a variable have_bricks to false.\nIf this boolean stays false all the way to the bottom of the function then state.stage_cleared gets switched to true and the game is won.\nInside the while loop, however, we check every entity to see if we find an entity.type of 'bricks' and if so, have_bricks gets flipped to true to stop the game from being won yet.\nSo that about does it for completing our checklist.\nThe game may not be as feature-complete as a true breakout game, but that room for improvement leaves opportunity for you to modify the game to work how you want it to.\nIt's really up to your imagination.\nTry out a few exercises if you can't think up any new features.\nIf you are having trouble running the game, be sure to check out the source code:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/breakout-5\nExercises\n\nInstead of getting a game over as soon as the ball touches the ground once, add a new property in state.lua named lives and set it to as many lives as you want the player to have.

bitmasks","keywords":"","body":"Binary and bitmasks\nIn 2.10 - Collision callbacks we saw how to react to entities colliding.\nIn this section we're going to discuss how we can better control when collisions happen.\nAs the title suggests, this will involve understanding some binary.\nLet's say we have a beat-em-up game where two players are fighting bad guys and we don't want players to collide with each other and instead only collide with enemies.\nThe collision callback could look something like this:\nlocal begin_contact_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b)\n  local entity_a_type = fixture_a:getUserData()\n  local entity_b_type = fixture_b:getUserData()\n  -- Check these aren't the same type of entity\n  if entity_a_type ~= entity_b_type then\n    -- Some code to handle the collision goes here...\n\n  end\nend\n\nBut what if you had power-ups and you want players to collide with the power-ups but you don't want enemies touching the power-ups?\nThings can get complicated pretty quickly:\nlocal begin_contact_callback = function(fixture_a, fixture_b)\n  local a = fixture_a:getUserData()\n  local b = fixture_b:getUserData()\n  if (a == 'powerup' and b == 'player') or (a == 'player' and b == 'powerup') then\n    -- Some power-up code...\n\n  -- Don't let power-ups collide with other entity types like bad guys\n  elseif a ~= b and a ~= 'powerup' and b~= 'powerup' then\n    -- Code to handle the rest of the collisions...\n\n  end\nend\n\nLet's find a better way!\nBinary operations\nBack in 1.0 - Programming basics we discussed operations– how to operate on strings with equality (==) checks, how to operate on numbers with arithmetic operations, and even how to perform boolean operations like and and or.\nBinary numbers have their own operations, often called bitwise operations.\nTo perform binary operations, let's first look at how to represent binary numbers.\nTyping a number like 101, Lua will interpret it as a decimal number (literally one-hundred one) so we need to represent it as a string and convert it to a number.\nTo convert a string to a number, you pass in the number and the base (base-2 in this case) like so:\nprint(tonumber('101', 2))\n\nWhich converts the binary number 101 to decimal when it prints out:\n5\nFor counting in binary and learning how to read and convert between binary and decimal, there are many resources that already explain it in much better.\nLearning how to do the conversions isn't necessary to learning these basic binary operations, but is an essential skill to have in the field of computer science.\nMoving on, let's take a look at some of the basic operations.\nAND\nBinary numbers are similar to booleans in that binary only has 1's and 0's.\nThe AND operator also works similarly to the boolean and.\nYou give it two digits and both must be 1 (true) for the output to be 1.\nUnfortunately at the time of writing this the online REPL has an outdated version of Lua that doesn't support binary operations.\nNo worries, let's create a main.lua file and try it out using LÖVE.\nTo perform binary operations, the included 'bit' library must be loaded.\nWhen required, it will return a table with many functions in it related to binary operations.\nThe first function we'll try, bit.band() performs a binary AND operation.\nlocal bit = require('bit')\n\nprint(bit.band(0, 0))\nprint(bit.band(0, 1))\nprint(bit.band(1, 0))\nprint(bit.band(1, 1))\n\nThis will print to the debug console:\n0\n0\n0\n1\nYou can pass it the decimals 1 and 0 as those numbers are the same in binary and decimal.\nThe operation is not limited to two inputs:\nprint(bit.band(1, 0, 1))\n\nYou can also pass it multi-digit numbers:\nprint(bit.band(\n  tonumber('111', 2),\n  tonumber('101', 2)\n))\n\nNote that you need to always use tonumber() to convert your binary string to a number as the function always expects a decimal number.\nLikewise the output will always be a decimal number:\n5\nLay it out like an arithmetic table and you can solve it just as easily:\n  111\n  101\n  ---\n  101 --> 5\n\n\n  11011010\n  10111100\n  --------\n  10011000 --> 152\nOR\nLike with the boolean or, the binary OR output will be 1 if either the first or the second number is 1.\nYou could say it is the least picky operator in that it doesn't care as long as it gets a 1 somewhere at least once.\n-- main.lua\nlocal bit = require('bit')\n\nprint(bit.bor(1, 1))\nprint(bit.bor(1, 0))\nprint(bit.bor(0, 0))\nprint(bit.bor(0, 0, 0, 1, 0))\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\nXOR\nXor (exclusive or), returns 1 only when it gets one 1.\nLet's compare XOR in a table to the others:\nAND\n\n\n\ninput A\ninput B\noutput\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\n\ninput A\ninput B\noutput\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\nXOR\n\n\n\ninput A\ninput B\noutput\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\nBinary operations are some of the most fundamental computer operations and can be physically built with a few transistors.\nGiven the simplicity of these operations, it also makes for a fast method of calculating collisions.\nBitmasks\n\nLet's take a look at this scene for a moment and identify from the crudely drawn shapes some potential entities:\n\nAll these entities fall into unique categories in that we want each of them to collide with certain other entities.\nIf this were a game, we'd define each category with a unique binary digit, or bit, so let's first do that:\n\n\n\nentity\ncategory\n\n\n\n\nsun\n0000\n\n\nplayer\n0001\n\n\npowerup\n0010\n\n\nenemy\n0100\n\n\nground\n1000\n\n\n\nLet's set some rules for each of these entities.\nFor instance, we want the player to collide with the powerup (0010), enemy (0100), and of course the ground (1000).\nTo tell the game engine this, we create a bitmask for the fixture.\nThis is a binary number with all the bits switched on that we want the entity to collide with.\nIn other words, the player's bitmask would be (1110).\nWe left the first bit blank so that the player can't collide with other potential players (player 2).\nLet's update the table with the bitmask we want each entity to have:\n\n\n\nentity\ncategory\nbitmask\n\n\n\n\nsun\n0000\n0000\n\n\nplayer\n0001\n1110\n\n\npowerup\n0010\n1001\n\n\nenemy\n0100\n1001\n\n\nground\n1000\n1111\n\n\n\nSo how does it all come together and work?\nWhen two entity's fixtures contact, a binary AND operation is performed again the entity's bitmask and the other entity's category.\nIf the resulting number isn't 0000 then we have a collision.\nTake the player and enemy for instance:\n0001   player's category\n1001   enemy's bitmask\n----\n0001   we have a collision\nAnd how about the enemy and the powerup:\n0100   enemy's category\n1001   powerup's bitmask\n----\n0000   we have NO collision\nArmed with this knowledge, we can assert the following information from the table above:\n\nThe sun collides with nothing (and doesn't even get a category). It's just in the background and non-interactive.\nThe player collides with everything except other players (and of course the sun).\nThe powerup collides only with the ground and players.\nThe enemy collides only with the ground and players.\nThe ground collides with everything.\n\nCopy or download the \"collision\" game from the example code and run it:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/collision\nDo the entities interact as expected?\nTake a look inside the entities folder to see the particular function being called to accomplish apply the categories and bitmasks to each entity– Fixture:setFilterData\n-- square.lua\n...\nsquare.category = tonumber('0001', 2)\nsquare.mask = tonumber('1110', 2)\nsquare.group = 0\n...\nsquare.fixture:setFilterData(square.category, square.mask, square.group)\n\nThe examples above only use 4 bits for the category and mask bceause that's all we needed, however LÖVE supports up to 16 bits for the category and bitmask (0000000000000000).\nThe group property isn't used and should be set to 0 when it isn't.\nWe haven't mentioned groups before because if you know how to use categories and bitmasks then you don't need to use groups as categories and bitmasks offer a more powerful way of doing the same thing.\nThat being said, collision groups should be relatively straight-forward to learn about so it will be left up as an exercise to read and study.\nExercises\n\nPlay with the bitmasks. Can you make the enemy collide with the powerup instead of the player?\nTake a look at how groups work as described in Fixture:setGroupIndex. This is a simpler, but more limited method of detecting collision. Can it be used to imitate the collision rules above?\n\n"},"pages/02-17-networking-part-1.html":{"url":"pages/02-17-networking-part-1.html","title":"2.17 - Networking (part 1)","keywords":"","body":"Networking (part 1)\nWhen creating a program such as a game, one of the first things to consider should be whether it is a networked application.\nSuch a choice will radically change the structure and complexity of the application.\nTo build a networked (\"online\") multiplayer game, we must understand some networking basics.\nSome of this information is oversimplified, but let's establish a baseline of knowledge.\nInternet protocol (IP)\nNetworks are possible because computers agree on a way to communicate with each other.\nLike ogres, messages sent across the internet have many layers.\nEach layer represents a different protocol that interprets how the message should be handled.\nThe internet protocol (IP) tells computers how to relay messages to their intended destination.\nThere are two things we need to know about this protocol: IP addresses and ports.\nEvery device connected to the internet has an IP address assigned to it when it connects.\nMessages sent out from your device are sent with a destination IP address attached so it knows where to go.\nMessages are relayed from one machine to another until it reaches the destination machine's address.\nIf you open your terminal or command prompt and type ping google.com you will get a response back that tells you the destination IP address; The IP address of the server running the google.com homepage you see.\nYou may even be able to type that IP address into your web browser and it will direct you to the website in the same fashion typing google.com in the address bar would (although this won't work for all websites because of unrelated, complicated reasons).\nLet's say you connected to google.com through the IP address 172.217.7.14.\nYou're actually connecting to that IP through a specific port.\nPorts are represented as numbers, so that IP like most every other website on the internet is accessed through port 443.\nIP ports are like the maritime ports that harbor ships.\nA single destination can have multiple ports for different purposes.\nIf I were bringing in a military vessel I may go to a different port than a commercial vessel.\nDepending on your intentions for a network connection you will use different IP ports.\nFor instance, if you are trying to view a website located at 172.217.7.14 you will use port 443 for an HTTPS connection, port 80 for an HTTP connection (if allowed), and if I am an administrator of the machine running on 172.217.7.14 I will use a completely different port to establish a backdoor connection such as port 22.\nFor our example program we will try connecting to a special reserved IP address, 127.0.0.1.\nThis IP address is your machine's own IP address it uses when it wants to connect to itself.\nSince we'll be testing our program by running both copies on the same computer we won't need to worry about multiple IP addresses for now.\nFor the port you have a range from 0 to 65535 and it doesn't really matter which one you use so long as it's not already in use or being reserved for other purposes.\nWe'll pick a random one that is unlikely to be in use by other programs... 6789.\nTransport layer\nThe transport layer decides how your data will be packaged and streamed.\nYou have a choice on a few different protocols for the transport layer.\nUnderstanding the details of each protocol in the transport layer isn't too important for this section of the book but let's discuss why we may want to use one or the other.\n\nTCP - This protocol provides different features to make sure data doesn't get corrupt. Most notably, it waits for a confirmation response from the other end to make sure the message was received. If a response isn't received by a certain timeout then the connection is considered a failure. Websites use TCP 99% of the time because of its reliability and ensuring you've received the site's full content.\nUDP - This protocol sends data to a server and expects no response back. Sending data without confirming it reaches the destination could lead to less reliable data transportation. However, less back and forth communication could mean a faster connection. This protocol is used by applications needing to send lots of data quickly, like an audio stream or a video game. This is the protocol we'll use.\n\nImagine you have two players needing to communicate their position with each other so we decide to use UDP.\nYou may send messages back and forth several times a second to communicate your positions.\nSince you are sending data so rapidly, if one of those messages is lost then the player position can be re-synchronized next message.\nThis is fast and unless one of the players has a faulty internet connection you typically won't notice a small jitter or hiccup every now and then.\nNow imagine another scenario where we want to send a message that a player gained an extra life.\nIf we were using UDP and that message got lost, we could have two online players with out-of-sync information that would ultimately jeopardize gameplay.\nOne solution around this would be to use TCP for mission-critical messages and UDP for everything else.\nAnother solution is to keep all messages in UDP, but to write a callback in Lua around our mission-critical messages to check that we get a reply.\nYup, you can have your application send UDP messages and expect a response but even though UDP doesn't have this feature as part of its protocol you can still program in your application a timeout that expects a response.\nThis sounds like a lot of work, but Lua and many other languages have libraries available you can require in your project that do this for you.\nWe'll see how easy this is later on.\nApplication layer\nFinally we have the protocol we create for each running copy of a game to know how to communicate once a connection is established.\nFor instance if a message with the string \"ping\" is being received, we may want to respond \"pong\".\nThe more complicated the game is, the more complicated the protocol will be.\nLet's check out one of the libraries Lua offers for networking and build a test program with a basic application protocol where the server responds to \"meow\" with \"bark\" and the client responds to \"bark\" with \"meow\".\nAs you can guess this will lead to an infinite back-and-forth conversation between the two hosts if we are successful.\nENet\nThere are several third-party libraries for Lua for networking.\nLÖVE includes two of the most popular, LuaSocket and lua-enet.\nLuaSocket is very flexible and allows you to create TCP and UDP connections.\nLua-enet is built on top of the ENet library, a simple yet high performance networking library.\nIt uses UDP, but handles everything around the transport layer for us so we can focus on our application layer.\nIt even does message confirmation over UDP for us when we need it to so we get the best of both worlds.\nLet's create a server and client program in LÖVE and we'll run them separately, connecting them to each other.\nOur server application\nCreate a folder called server and in it create a file named server.lua.\nWe'll start by requiring enet:\n-- server/server.lua\nlocal enet = require('enet')\n\nThis file will return a table of functions for starting and stopping the server.\nTo start the server, we need to create a host and tell it which IP address and port it is running on.\nLet's create a server.start function that does just that:\n-- server/server.lua\nlocal enet = require('enet')\n\nlocal host\nlocal server = {}\n\nserver.start = function()\n  host = enet.host_create('127.0.0.1:6789')\nend\n\nreturn server\n\nThe IP address is 127.0.0.1 as we said we would use.\nThat is telling ENet we want to start the server on our machine's local address.\nThe IP address is followed by a colon (:) then the port number (6789) which is an arbitrary port that should be free to use.\nIf we create a main.lua file we can require server.lua and create a server when LÖVE starts.\n-- server/main.lua\n-- Our server application\nlocal server = require('server')\n\nlove.load = function()\n  server.start()\nend\n\nIf we try and run this, nothing will happen.\nLet's define love.draw and print some text to tell us when someone connects to our server:\n-- server/main.lua\n-- Our server application\nlocal server = require('server')\n\nlove.load = function()\n  -- Keep text pixels sharp and intact instead of blurring\n  -- https://love2d.org/wiki/FilterMode\n  love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')\n\n  server.start()\nend\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  -- Scale up the size of the text being printed\n  local transform = love.math.newTransform(0, 0, 0, 3)\n  if server.is_connected() then\n    love.graphics.print('client connected to us (see console)', transform)\n  else\n    love.graphics.print('server started... awaiting clients', transform)\n  end\nend\n\n-- It's convenient to be able to press escape to close the program\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  if pressed_key == 'escape' then\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\nend\n\nWith this done, we need to figure out how the server knows someone is connected.\nWe call server.is_connected() in love.draw, so let's start by defining that:\n-- server/server.lua\nlocal enet = require('enet')\n\nlocal host\nlocal received_data = false\nlocal server = {}\n\nserver.start = function()\n  host = enet.host_create('127.0.0.1:6789')\nend\n\nserver.is_connected = function()\n  return received_data\nend\n\nreturn server\n\nOk, so server.is_connected() will return the value of received_data which defaults to false.\nNow the part that does all the action:\n-- server/server.lua\nlocal enet = require('enet')\n\nlocal host\nlocal peer\nlocal received_data = false\nlocal server = {}\n\nserver.start = function()\n  host = enet.host_create('127.0.0.1:6789')\nend\n\nserver.is_connected = function()\n  return received_data\nend\n\nserver.update = function()\n  if not host then return end\n  local event = host:service()\n  if event then\n    received_data = true\n    peer = event.peer\n    print('----')\n    for k, v in pairs(event) do\n      print(k, v)\n    end\n    event.peer:send('bark')\n  end\nend\n\nreturn server\n\nLet's take a close look at server.update piece by piece.\nFirst thing is an if statement to check that host is defined.\nIf server.update is called before server.start then it won't be so there is no server update to be made.\nIf our server host was created and we get past the if-statement check, we call host:service().\nIf we read the documentation for host:service we can see the purpose of calling this is to check for any incoming packets (messages) and send out any we have queued up.\nIf we receive any, we will get back an event table.\nIf we do get an event table, we'll change received_data to true (which in turn means server.is_connected() now returns true).\nNext we will capture the peer (the client) that sent us this data which we can use to send messages to later:\npeer = event.peer\n\nWhile we have the event table, let's just iterate over it and print its contents to the console:\nfor k, v in pairs(event) do\n  print(k, v)\nend\n\nThen finally we'll send the client a message that simply reads \"bark\".\nevent.peer:send('bark')\n\nWe can now call server.update inside our game loop's love.update function:\nlove.update = function()\n  server.update()\nend\n\nWe need to test our server, but to test our server, we need a client.\nOur client application\nCreate a \"client\" folder like the \"server\" folder created above.\nMost of the code will be identical to our server.\nThe main difference is that when we create a host we won't pass it an IP address and port to serve on, but instead will tell it to connect to the address and port the server is running on.\n-- client/main.lua\n-- Our client application\nlocal client = require('client')\n\nlove.load = function()\n  -- Keep text pixels sharp and intact instead of blurring\n  -- https://love2d.org/wiki/FilterMode\n  love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')\n\n  client.start()\nend\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  -- Scale up the size of the text being printed\n  local transform = love.math.newTransform(0, 0, 0, 3)\n  if client.is_connected() then\n    love.graphics.print('connected to server (see console)', transform)\n  else\n    love.graphics.print('establishing a connection...', transform)\n  end\nend\n\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  if pressed_key == 'escape' then\n    love.event.quit()\n  end\nend\n\nlove.update = function()\n  client.update()\nend\n\n-- client/client.lua\nlocal enet = require('enet')\nlocal client = {}\nlocal host\nlocal peer\nlocal received_data = false\n\nclient.start = function()\n  host = enet.host_create()\n  peer = host:connect('127.0.0.1:6789')\nend\n\nclient.is_connected = function()\n  return received_data\nend\n\nclient.update = function()\n  if host then\n    local event = host:service()\n    if event then\n      received_data = true\n      print('----')\n      for k, v in pairs(event) do\n        print(k, v)\n      end\n      event.peer:send('meow')\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nreturn client\n\nIf we receive a message from the server we'll \"meow\" back at it.\nTesting things out\nIf you run the server you will see a message saying \"server started... awaiting clients\".\nSince we are printing to the console, if you are running this code on Windows remember that you will need to enable the console.\nThis can be done by creating a conf.lua file in both the client and server folders.\n-- LÖVE configuration file\n\nlove.conf = function(t)\n  t.console = true        -- Enable the debug console for Windows.\n  t.window.width = 800    -- Game's screen width (number of pixels)\n  t.window.height = 600   -- Game's screen height (number of pixels)\nend\n\nIf the server is up and running with the console enabled, go ahead and start the client with its console enabled too.\nYou should immediately see a flood of events printing out in the server and client consoles.\nServer console:\n----\npeer    127.0.0.1:58384\nchannel 0\ndata    meow\ntype    receive\nClient console:\n----\npeer    127.0.0.1:6789\nchannel 0\ndata    bark\ntype    receive\nThis will go back and forth until you close either one of them.\nIf you close one though, the messages will stop and it will just sit there.\nIf you close the server first, for instance, the client will sit there then after several seconds a message will appear:\n----\npeer    127.0.0.1:6789\ndata    0\ntype    disconnect\nNormally a disconnect like this wouldn't be detected with UDP, but the ENet library sends \"heartbeat\" messages back and forth to make sure both peers are still connected to each other.\nThe timeout is defined to be somewhere between 5 and 30 seconds before the peer realizes it has been disconnnected from the other one.\nJust to polish things off here, let's make ENet send a disconnect event to the other peer immediately when we are closing our application.\nThe lua-enet documentation lists a function we can invoke to do that, peer:disconnect_now.\nLÖVE has a love.quit callback that is called when our application is closing.\nWe can write a server.disconnect function and call it from love.quit.\nServer:\n-- server/main.lua\n\n...\n\nlove.quit = function()\n  server.disconnect()\nend\n\n-- server/server.lua\n\n...\n\nserver.disconnect = function()\n  if peer then\n    peer:disconnect_now()\n    peer = nil\n  end\n  host = nil\n  received_data = false\nend\n\nThe client.disconnect code would be identical.\nTo see this full example or if you have any problems getting your code to run check out the code on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/tree/master/code/networking-1\nIn the next part we will look at network architecture and add entities to the screen to work with.\nExercises\n\nWhat happens if you try to connect multiple clients to the server? What about running multiple servers on the same IP address and port? Why does it behave like it does?\n\n"},"pages/02-18-networking-part-2.html":{"url":"pages/02-18-networking-part-2.html","title":"2.18 - Networking (part 2)","keywords":"","body":"Networking (part 2)\nIn the previous section we made two applications that could talk to each other.\nOne application was the server and the second one connecting to it was the client.\nIn game design this style of networking can be described as a direct connection.\nDirect connection\n\nIn a direct connection one of the players takes on the role of server, meaning their game world is the ultimate authority if there are any discrepancies or out-of-sync communication between the two.\nThis also means the server player can find ways to cheat and exploit the game.\nOne of the advantages to this setup is since you are directly connected to each other, you get as minimal lag as possible.\nThis advantage doesn't hold true if there are more than 2 players.\nIf player 1 is the server and player 2 and 3 are connected to player 1, then player 2 and 3 have to relay updates to each other through player 1 instead of directly to each other.\nOutside of 2-player games, this setup isn't as popular as having a dedicated server.\nDedicated server\n\nDedicated servers are exactly what they sound like.\nThey are hosts dedicated to serving players.\nThe difference here is all players are clients and the server is a neutral ground where players can connect and communicate indirectly with each other through it.\nServers typically run a modified version of the game code that has no user interface and therefore can run on a less expensive computer.\nIf one of the players is detected cheating the server can detect that something is wrong and kick them from the game.\nThe server is the ultimate authority over the state of the game world.\nOur network setup will sort of be a mix between the two styles of networking.\nWe'll have a dedicated server that doesn't participate in the gameplay, but the server will have a graphical interface so we can view what is going on during our testing.\nConsolidating our code\nRather than managing two folders of code like in the previous section, we'll combine the code and use a menu system to select between being a server and being a client.\nThe menu code isn't important to this tutorial so try to focus on the client and server code as before.\nThe refactored code can be found in the code repository here.\nGiven the amount of files it is easiest to download the zip of the whole project where you will find the relevant files inside code/networking-2: https://github.com/RVAGameJams/learn2love/archive/master.zip\nOnce downloaded, when you run the program you should be greeted with a menu screen like so:\n\nTest it out and confirm you can connect a server and client instance with the new code.\nOk.\nThe modifications to main.lua should be easy enough to understand.\nLet's take a look at that and the new \"net\" service first before we begin making any modifications.\nAt the top of the file we're loading the net and menu services then telling the menu service which menu to load on startup:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal menu_service = require('services/menu')\nlocal net_service = require('services/net')\n\nlove.load = function()\n  -- Keep text pixels sharp and intact instead of blurring\n  -- https://love2d.org/wiki/FilterMode\n  love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')\n\n  menu_service.load('main-menu')\nend\n\nNext, if a key is pressed it will pass that pressed-key event to the menu service.\nIf we are in the game and no menu is loaded, the menu service will do nothing with the event.\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  menu_service.handle_keypress(pressed_key)\nend\n\nInside love.draw we have a similar story.\nIf we have an active menu then menu_service.draw() will draw it\nOtherwise it won't do anything.\n(If you open services/menu.lua you will see the draw function where this all happens.)\nlove.draw = function()\n  menu_service.draw()\n  -- Scale up the size of the text being printed\n  local transform = love.math.newTransform(0, 0, 0, 3)\n  if net_service.is_connected() then\n    love.graphics.print('peer connected (see console)', transform)\n  end\nend\n\nAnother thing inside love.draw is a check to see if we've made a connection either as server or client (using net_service.is_connected()) then draw the \"peer connected\" text on the screen as before.\nWe use the word \"peer\" as a generic term to refer to either the client we're connected to (if we're the server) or the server (if we're the client).\nInside love.update and love.quit we have combined the code we had before and added a menu.update() call.\nIf there is a menu, update it.\nIf either a server host or client host is running, net.update() will update it.\nlove.update = function()\n  menu_service.update()\n  net_service.update()\nend\n\nlove.quit = function()\n  net_service.disconnect()\nend\n\nSo everywhere we were calling \"server\" or \"client\" we just call net_service and it will do it's thing no matter the type of connection.\nLet's open up net.lua and we'll see something very close to the original code:\n-- net.lua\n\nlocal enet = require('enet')\n\n-- Populate one or the other depending if we start a server or client host\nlocal client_host\nlocal server_host\n\n-- As a server, we want to keep track of all the connected clients\nlocal peers = {}\nlocal received_data = false\n\n-- The service we will be returning\nlocal net = {}\n\nAt the top of the file we create some empty local variables.\nThe net table is full of functions that are being used in main.lua and elsewhere.\nnet.start_server = function()\n  server_host = enet.host_create('localhost:6789')\nend\n\nnet.start_client = function()\n  client_host = enet.host_create()\n  server_host = client_host:connect('localhost:6789')\nend\n\nOn the menu when you select \"Host\" or \"Join\", the net.start_server and net.start_client functions are being called respectively.\nBelow that are some functions to check what kind of connection we have:\nnet.is_connected = function()\n  return received_data\nend\n\nnet.is_client = function()\n  return client_host and true or false\nend\n\nnet.is_server = function()\n  return server_host and not client_host\nend\n\nThen finally we have the update and disconnect code like we originally had in the server and client services, but combined.\nOne addition to the disconnect function is we are looping over the peers list.\nThe peers list exists because we are expecting to have multiple players connect to the server and if the server is running, it will want to disconnect from them all when the game quits.\nCommunication layer\nBefore we update the code, let's discuss the functionality and draw out the network communication for that functionality.\n\nWhen connecting to the server you should have a controllable player spawn on screen\nWhen you move your player, your peers should be able to see your player move\nWhen other peers move their players, you should be able to see them move\nEach player should look different so you know which one is you\n\n\n\n\nClient\nServer\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n(Create a host)\n(Create a host)\nBoth client and server's net services are booted. No communication has been made between the two at this point.\n\n\nSend \"connect\" message to server\n\nClient sends a connect message automatically. This will be interpreted as a request to join the game.\n\n\n\n(Spawn entity)\nServer generates and stores all the entities in the game. When spawning an entity, associate the client's connection ID with it.\n\n\n\nRespond \"your-id|4177457821|100|500\"\nServer responds by passing the client a \"your-id\" message. All messages sent must be strings so in this case where multiple values need to be embedded in the message, each value is separated by a pipe (\"|\") character to help us re-separate the values when receiving the message client side. The first value is the unique player ID that the server has assigned the client, followed by the X position then Y position.\n\n\n\nSend \"peer-id|233142890|326|177\"\nServer sends the new client other peers that need to be spawned on screen. Included are the ID, X and Y position of that player.\n\n\n\nSend \"move|233142890|327|177\"\nServer is letting the client know the player with the ID \"233142890\" has changed position. Notice the updated X position.\n\n\n\nSend \"move|233142890|328|177\"\nAnother move update.\n\n\nSend \"move|100|502\"\n\nClient is letting the server know it is moving its player too.\n\n\n\nSend \"peer-id|81850530|500|500\"\nAnother player has joined the server.\n\n\n\nAdding entities\nOn connection from a client, the server needs to spawn entities so let's create an entity service for handling all our entity-related needs:\n-- entity.lua\n\nlocal entity_service = {}\n\n-- All player entities\nentity_service.entities = {}\n\nentity_service.spawn = function(player_id, x_pos, y_pos)\n  return {\n    -- TODO: We'll add a color randomizer later\n    color = {1, 1, 1, 1},\n    id = player_id,\n    -- TODO: We'll add a shape randomizer later too\n    shape = love.physics.newPolygonShape(0, 0, 50, 0, 50, 50, 0, 50),\n    x_pos = x_pos,\n    y_pos = y_pos\n  }\nend\n\nentity_service.draw = function(entity)\n  love.graphics.setColor(entity.color)\n  local points = { entity.shape:getPoints() }\n  for idx, point in ipairs(points) do\n    if idx % 2 == 1 then\n      points[idx] = point + entity.x_pos\n    else\n      points[idx] = point + entity.y_pos\n    end\n  end\n  love.graphics.polygon('line', points)\nend\n\nreturn entity_service\n\nThese entities will just be basic shapes.\nNo world, body, or fixtures to worry about as dealing with physics is a bit out of the scope of this section.\nNow we'll do some heavy upgrades to the net service.\nSomewhere near the top of the file we'll define two tables with callbacks that will get invoked when an event comes in.\nThey'll be empty functions for now and we'll fill them out as we go.\n-- Callbacks to invoke when certain events are received from a peer\n-- Define a callback to handle every type of message in our application protocol\nlocal message_handlers = {\n  ['your-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n  end,\n  ['peer-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n  end,\n  ['move'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n  end\n}\n-- These event types are defined by Lua-enet. A \"receive\" type of event\n-- is a generic event that carries any of the messages above.\nlocal event_handlers = {\n  connect = function(event, is_server)\n  end,\n  disconnect = function(event, is_server)\n  end,\n  receive = function(event, is_server)\n  end\n}\n\nThen we'll modify the net.update function so it can call one of the three callbacks inside the event_handlers table:\nnet.update = function()\n  local host = client_host or server_host\n  if not host then return end\n  local event = host:service()\n  if event then\n    received_data = true\n    -- event.type will be either \"connect\", \"disconnect\", or \"receive\"\n    event_handlers[event.type](event, net.is_server())\n    -- Print out the event table for debug purposes\n    print('----')\n    for k, v in pairs(event) do\n      print(k, v)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nSo you see, event_handlers.connect will be called when a \"connect\" type event comes in and we'll pass it the event and net.is_server() boolean as its two parameters.\nNow we can go back and fill out the \"connect\" event handler.\nRead each code comment as there is a lot going on here in just a few lines of code.\nlocal event_handlers = {\n  connect = function(event, is_server)\n    -- Only the server needs to do stuff here on connect\n    if is_server then\n      -- event.peer:connect_id() provides us with a unique number.\n      -- We'll convert that number to a string and use it as the player ID.\n      local player = entity_service.spawn(tostring(event.peer:connect_id()), 100, 100)\n      -- Store this player in the player table with the player ID as the key.\n      entity_service.entities[player.id] = player\n      -- Send the initial \"your-id\" message back to the connecting client so they can spawn this entity too.\n      event.peer:send('your-id|' .. player.id .. '|' .. player.x_pos .. '|' .. player.y_pos)\n    end\n  end,\n  disconnect = function(event, is_server)\n    -- TODO: Add code to remove entities when a client disconnects\n  end,\n  receive = function(event, is_server)\n    -- TODO: Add code to parse \"receive\" events and call the appropriate message handler callback\n  end\n}\n\nSince we're using the entity service in net.lua we'll need to require it at the very top:\nlocal entity_service = require('services/entity')\n\nNow that the player receives the message to spawn an entity, we can fill out the \"receive\" event handler.\nlocal event_handlers = {\n  connect = function(event, is_server)\n    -- Only the server needs to do stuff here on connect\n    if is_server then\n      -- event.peer:connect_id() provides us with a unique number.\n      -- We'll convert that number to a string and use it as the player ID.\n      local player = entity_service.spawn(tostring(event.peer:connect_id()), 100, 100)\n      -- Store this player in the player table with the player ID as the key.\n      entity_service.entities[player.id] = player\n      -- Send the initial \"your-id\" message back to the connecting client so they can spawn this entity too.\n      event.peer:send('your-id|' .. player.id .. '|' .. player.x_pos .. '|' .. player.y_pos)\n    end\n  end,\n  disconnect = function(event, is_server)\n    -- TODO: Add code to remove entities when a client disconnects\n  end,\n  receive = function(event, is_server)\n    -- Extract the message out from the event and call the appropriate callback above\n    local message = {}\n    for match in (event.data .. '|'):gmatch('(.-)|') do\n      table.insert(message, match)\n    end\n    message_handlers[message[1]](message, event, is_server)\n  end\n}\n\nDon't let this code feel intimidating as it's only taking the string message from the event (\"your-id:87335:500:500\") and splitting it into a list table ({ \"your-id\", \"87335\", \"500\", \"500\" }) so we can work with the data.\nOnce we have the message fragments, we call message_handlers[message[1]](), where message[1] will be one of the keys in the message_handlers table: \"your-id\", \"peer-id\", or \"move\".\nLet's fill out the \"your-id\" handler first:\n-- Callbacks to invoke when certain events are received from a peer\n-- Define a callback to handle every type of message in our application protocol\nlocal message_handlers = {\n  ['your-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n    local player_id = message[2]\n    local x_pos = message[3]\n    local y_pos = message[4]\n    entity_service.player_id = player_id\n    entity_service.entities[player_id] = entity_service.spawn(player_id, x_pos, y_pos)\n  end,\n  ['peer-id'] = function(message, event_is_server)\n  end,\n  ['move'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n  end\n}\n\nNow when the client gets the \"your-id\" message, it can spawn an entity too.\nLet's add the appropriate code to main.lua for drawing entities so we can see if our protocol is working so far:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal entity_service = require('services/entity')\n\n...\nlove.draw = function()\n  menu_service.draw()\n  -- Scale up the size of the text being printed\n  local transform = love.math.newTransform(0, 0, 0, 3)\n  if net_service.is_connected() and net_service.is_server() then\n    love.graphics.setColor({1, 1, 1, 1})\n    love.graphics.print('Server preview. See console for details.', transform)\n  end\n  for _, entity in pairs(entity_service.entities) do\n    entity_service.draw(entity)\n  end\nend\n\nIf you've updated everything correctly, you'll see this happen when a server and client run side-by-side:\n\nIf you get an error, remember to check the line number and filename where the error occurred and make sure the code looks similar to how it is above.\nIf you get stuck, there will be a full example available at the bottom of this section.\nIf everything is working for you then fantastic.\nThis means the server and client are successfully syncing an entity state with each other.\nNext let's add movement so we can see live updates happening between the two game windows.\nInside the services folder, we'll create an input.lua file that returns an empty table:\n-- input.lua\n\nreturn {}\n\nWhy are we returning an empty table?\nWell, it's only empty right now, but as keys are pressed and released our table will get updated.\nLet's update love.keypressed and add a love.keyreleased function to main.lua to see how that works:\n-- main.lua\n\nlocal input_service = require('services/input')\n\n...\nlove.keypressed = function(pressed_key)\n  menu_service.handle_keypress(pressed_key)\n  input_service[pressed_key] = true\nend\n\nlove.keyreleased = function(released_key)\n  input_service[released_key] = false\nend\n\nNow when we press some arrow keys for instance, our table in input.lua will look more like this in memory:\n{\n  left = true,\n  right = false,\n  up = true,\n  down = false\n}\n\nNow inside entity.lua we'll add an entity_service.move function that checks for input changes and moves the entity if any of the arrow keys are pressed:\n-- entity.lua\n\nlocal input_service = require('services/input')\n\n...\nentity_service.move = function()\n  local player = entity_service.entities[entity_service.player_id]\n\n  -- Don't let the player press up and down at the same time\n  if input_service.up and not input_service.down then\n    player.y_pos = player.y_pos - 2\n  elseif input_service.down and not input_service.up then\n    player.y_pos = player.y_pos + 2\n  end\n\n  -- Don't let the player press left and right at the same time\n  if input_service.left and not input_service.right then\n    player.x_pos = player.x_pos - 2\n  elseif input_service.right and not input_service.left then\n    player.x_pos = player.x_pos + 2\n  end\nend\n\nThis will cause our entity to move across the client's screen, but the server won't get these updates unless the client sends them over.\nWe need to go back to main.lua and send a \"move\" message.\nInside love.update check to see if the player position has changed and send a move message to the server if so:\nlove.update = function()\n  menu_service.update()\n  -- Check to see if a player has spawned and update its movement if any direction keys are being pressed\n  if entity_service.player_id then\n    local player = entity_service.entities[entity_service.player_id]\n    local old_x = player.x_pos\n    local old_y = player.y_pos\n    entity_service.move()\n    if player.x_pos ~= old_x or player.y_pos ~= old_y then\n      net_service.send('move|' .. player.id .. '|' .. player.x_pos .. '|' .. player.y_pos)\n    end\n  end\n  net_service.update()\nend\n\nThe net_service.send function we haven't defined that yet.\nJump back over to net.lua and we'll define that for sending either client or server messages if needed:\nnet.send = function(message)\n  if net.is_client() then\n    server_host:send(message)\n  else\n    server_host:broadcast(message)\n  end\nend\n\nNow we are sending a message to the server when we move, but we need to have the server read the message and update the entity position on its end too.\nLet's fill out the \"move\" message handler in net.lua to accomplish this:\nlocal message_handlers = {\n  ['your-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n    local player_id = message[2]\n    local x_pos = message[3]\n    local y_pos = message[4]\n    entity_service.player_id = player_id\n    entity_service.entities[player_id] = entity_service.spawn(player_id, x_pos, y_pos)\n  end,\n  ['peer-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n    -- TODO: handle peer-id messages for when more players join the server\n  end,\n  ['move'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n    local player_id = message[2]\n    local x_pos = message[3]\n    local y_pos = message[4]\n    entity_service.entities[player_id].x_pos = x_pos\n    entity_service.entities[player_id].y_pos = y_pos\n    if is_server then\n      -- Relay this message to the other players\n      for id, peer in pairs(peers) do\n        if id ~= player_id then\n          peer:send(event.data)\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\n}\n\nNotice the extra server check.\nIf the server received the \"move\" command it should relay it over to any other connected player so they can see you moving too.\nThe peers table needs to be defined inside net.lua above the message handlers or you may get an error when it tries to loop over the table and sees a nil value that hasn't been defined yet.\nTry it out again and we should see the square moving on both screens now.\nAll that hard work is starting to pay off!\nWe have a few more changes to make for this to be fully functional though.\nIf you try and run the game now with multiple clients, the players won't see each other.\nIn our application protocol we defined a peer-id message so that when new players connect we receive information to spawn them.\nInside net.lua, go ahead and fill out the \"peer-id\" message handler so that it spawns an entity when invoked:\n  ['peer-id'] = function(message, event, is_server)\n    local player_id = message[2]\n    local x_pos = message[3]\n    local y_pos = message[4]\n    entity_service.entities[player_id] = entity_service.spawn(player_id, x_pos, y_pos)\n  end,\n\nNow the server needs to send all the peers to a new player connecting, but it also needs to send new players to pre-existing peers during a connect event.\nWe'll update the \"connect\" event handler to do that:\n  connect = function(event, is_server)\n    -- Only the server needs to do stuff here on connect\n    if is_server then\n      -- event.peer:connect_id() provides us with a unique number.\n      -- We'll convert that number to a string and use it as the player ID.\n      local player = entity_service.spawn(tostring(event.peer:connect_id()), 100, 100)\n      -- Store this player in the player table with the player ID as the key.\n      entity_service.entities[player.id] = player\n      -- Send the initial \"your-id\" message back to the connecting client so they can spawn this entity too.\n      event.peer:send('your-id|' .. player.id ..

You can crash the server by sending it an invalid message.\nThe \"move\" message expects a player id when the server should be able to figure this out on its own. The server can easily be fooled into accepting \"move\" messages from a client to move another client.\nTo make things simpler there is no world or physics nor any net code to handle collisions or anything of the like.\nThe entities just stick around when you close/disconnect a client.\nIf you lose connection, there is no attempt to restore the connection.\n\nThere is a great set of articles by Gabriel Gambetta on the problems faced by making a action-based multiplayer games and it's worth a read to get a high-level overview of the challenges and how to reason about them.\nLink to his articles.\nExercises\n\nHaving all the players spawn at the exact same point isn't ideal. Inside net.lua in the \"connect\" event handler, make a list of spawn points and make the players spawn at one of the points based on their peer:connect_id(). Hint: the code should look similar to the color cycle code inside entity.spawn in entity.lua.\nInside net.lua, complete the \"disconnect\" event handler and make is so when a client quits their entity is removed from the game for all peers.\n\n"},"pages/03-00-programming-in-depth.html":{"url":"pages/03-00-programming-in-depth.html","title":"3.0 - Programming in-depth","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 3: Programming in depth\nThe goal of this chapter is to touch on a variety of topics and problems faced while programming and to understand and solve them using Lua.\nA wider variety of topics will be covered here.\nOne topic will lead into another which will then build on top of concepts introduced in the previous topic.\n"},"pages/03-01-primitives-and-references.html":{"url":"pages/03-01-primitives-and-references.html","title":"3.01 - Primitives and references","keywords":"","body":"Primitives and references\nTake a look at this code:\nlocal string1 = \"hello\"\nlocal string2 = 'hello'\n\nprint(string1 == string2)\n\nlocal number1 = 14\nlocal number2 = 14\n\nprint(number1 == number2)\n\nlocal table1 = {}\nlocal table2 = {}\n\nprint(table1 == table2)\n\nlocal function1 = function() end\nlocal function2 = function() end\n\nprint(function1 == function2)\n\nWhat would happen if you were to run this?\nIn chapter 1 we learned about comparing strings with the == operator when we talked about booleans.\nRun the code above in the REPL and see what it returns:\ntrue\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse\nThe strings equal and the numbers equal, but why aren't the tables and functions equal since they are both empty?\nTry printing the tables and functions and look what happens:\nlocal table1 = {}\nlocal table2 = {}\n\nprint(table1)\nprint(table2)\n\nlocal function1 = function() end\nlocal function2 = function() end\n\nprint(function1)\nprint(function2)\n\ntable: 0x16af270\ntable: 0x16af220\nfunction: 0x16ae840\nfunction: 0x16aeff0\nAttempting to print each value you are given back a hexadecimal number, the place in memory where those values are located.\nEach table and function resides in a different place in memory.\nSo how is this relevant?\nWhen checking data like strings and numbers, the == operator does indeed check that the data matches.\nThese data types are simple and take very little effort for a computer to check that they are equal.\nBooleans, strings, numbers, and nil are all primitive types of data and behave this way.\nWhen checking data like functions and tables, however, the == operator checks the memory location of the data on both sides of the operator and if the variables reference the same location then they are equal.\nIn other words, the == operator checks these data types to see if they have the same identity.\nNo matter how many empty tables or functions you have, each one is created with a unique identity.\nlocal string1 = 'hello'\nlocal string2 = \"hello\"\n-- Another copy of \"hello\" is created in memory:\nlocal string3 = string2\n-- But these two copies are equal\nprint(string2 == string3)\n\nlocal table1 = {}\nlocal table2 = table1\nprint(table1 == table2)\n\nWhat is the result of print(table1 == table2)?\nAha! Both these variables reference the same data.\nQuick– a magician waves two wands in front of your face and asks you to count how many wands there are.\nHow do you know if there are really two wands or if this is just a trick with mirrors?\nWhat do you do?\nYou take one of the wands and break it of course.\nIf the other wand breaks then they were the same wand the entire time.\nLet's try that with the two objects:\nlocal table1 = {}\nlocal table2 = table1\ntable1.rabbit = 'white'\n\nprint(table2.rabbit) -- Equals 'white' too\n\nAs long as your variables reference the same table, updating the table from one variable you will see the result when checking the other variable.\nThis doesn't work with primitive data because you're always making a copy when assigning it to a new variable name:\nlocal string1 = 'hello'\nlocal string2 = string1\nstring1 = 'world'\n\nreturn string2\n\n=> hello\nPrimitive versus non-primitive data types\nWhenever we assign non-primitive data to a new variable, we're always referencing the original data:\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  'carrots',\n  'celery',\n  'pecans'\n}\n\nlocal same_list = grocery_list\n\ngrocery_list[1] = 'grapes'\n\nreturn same_list[1]\n\nBut assigning primitive data to a variable, even primitive data inside tables, we're always making a unique copy:\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  'carrots',\n  'celery',\n  'pecans'\n}\n\nlocal item_copy = grocery_list[1]\n\nprint('item_copy is ' .. item_copy)\n\ngrocery_list[1] = 'grapes'\n\nprint('item_copy still is ' .. item_copy)\n\nIf you need to make each item in your table reference-able, you need to make each item a non-primitive data type:\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  { name = 'carrots', location = 'produce' },\n  { name = 'celery', location = 'produce' },\n  { name = 'pecans', location = 'baking' }\n}\n\nlocal item_reference = grocery_list[1]\n\nprint('item_reference is ' .. item_reference.name)\n\ngrocery_list[1].name = 'grapes'\n\nprint('item_reference is now ' .. item_reference.name)\n\nSo rather than replacing the first item in the list, the first item was retained and only modified:\nitem_reference is carrots\nitem_reference is now grapes\n\nCloning non-primitive data types\nAs we are familiar with at this point, tables are a special data type that can contain other data types.\nYou can build structures containing strings, variables, and even other tables.\nThat makes the table a composite data type, in other words, a data type with distinguishable parts.\nNot all languages have composite data types, but for Lua the table is one of its primary features.\nOne thing a programmer may want to do with a table is once constructed, create a copy of it.\nIf there was a table for a monster in a video game, you may want to have more than one table.\nIf you did this:\nlocal enemy1 = { health = 10, strength = 12, type = 'orc' }\nlocal enemy2 = enemy1\n\nYou would still only have one table.\nYou could use a loop to copy all the values out of a table and into a brand new table.\nA function to do that may look like this, more or less:\nlocal copy = function(orig_table)\n  local new_table = {}\n  for key, value in pairs(orig_table) do\n    new_table[key] = value\n  end\n  return new_table\nend\n\nlocal enemy1 = { health = 10, strength = 12, type = 'orc' }\nlocal enemy2 = copy(enemy1)\n\nThere is nothing terribly wrong with this method, but a more efficient way to do such a thing would be to construct each monster table inside a function instead of copying one from another.\nThis method will be familiar already if you read and followed through the breakout game.\nlocal create_orc = function(strength)\n  return {\n    health = 10,\n    strength = strength,\n    type = 'orc'\n  }\nend\n\nlocal enemy1 = create_orc(12)\nlocal enemy2 = create_orc(12)\n\nEvery time the function create_orc is ran, it constructs a new table from scratch.\nYou define an orc-style table only once and don't need to read values in from one table to another.\nA function that constructs tables for you is a common paradigm in programming known as a factory function.\nYou made a factory that builds orcs!\nOf course this factory function paradigm works with other non-primitive types of data as well:\nlocal create_function = function()\n  return function() return 1 + 1 end\nend\n\nlocal fn1 = create_function()\nlocal fn2 = create_function()\n\nprint(fn1)\nprint(fn2)\n\nA function that generates other functions?\nThis may seem like an odd thing to want to do, but this method of programming can be quite useful as we'll see in 3.02 - Higher-order functions and later follow-up sections.\nOne thing that should be mentioned though is that functions can also be considered a composite data type as it can return other data types, and even other functions.\nComposite in that you can compose higher-order functionality in the way tables can be used to compose higher-order structures.\nConclusion\nWhen comparing or referencing data, always keep in mind whether you handling primitive or non-primitive data.\nIf you are modifying data in one place, think if this might be affecting you somewhere else in your program.\nEven when writing out a local some_module = require('some-module') in your code some_module is just a table and like every other table, every reference to it can affect each other.\nSo modifying some_module in two different files can have either beneficial or disastrous consequences depending how much care and regard you give your code.\n"},"pages/03-02-higher-order-functions.html":{"url":"pages/03-02-higher-order-functions.html","title":"3.02 - Higher-order functions","keywords":"","body":"Higher-order functions\nIn 1.07 Making functions we learned about, well, making functions.\nSo what about higher-order functions?\nWhat are they and how do we make them?\nSimply put, higher-order functions are functions built on top of other functions.\nHere's a basic example:\nlocal run_twice = function(some_function, some_data)\n  some_function(some_data)\n  some_function(some_data)\nend\n\nrun_twice(print, 'Hello World!')\n\nIt can take any function and run it twice for you, in this case the print function, but it could be any function you pass it.\nTypically higher-order functions return data.\nHere's a trickier example that does just that:\nlocal twice = function(fn, val)\n    return fn(fn(val))\nend\n\nlocal add_four = function(num)\n    return num + 4\nend\n\nreturn twice(add_four, 12)\n\nTake a look at the bottom line for a second.\nWe are calling the function twice with two arguments, the add_four function and the number 12.\nThe purpose of the twice function is to take a value, 12 in this case, and run it through the given function (add_four) twice.\nNow take a look inside the twice function.\nInside it returns fn(fn(val)).\nGiven what we know is being passed to this function, this can be read as saying add_four(add_four(12)).\nThe order of operation says to start from the inner-most parenthesis and work your way out:\nadd_four(add_four(12))\nbecomes\nadd_four(16)\nwhich becomes\n20\nand that is what is returned when you run the code.\nThe power of these higher-order functions is that they are re-usable.\nYou can give the twice function anything that takes and returns a value:\nlocal twice = function(fn, val)\n    return fn(fn(val))\nend\n\nlocal double = function(number)\n    return number * 2\nend\n\nreturn twice(double, 3)\n\n...or similar to our original example:\nlocal twice = function(fn, val)\n    return fn(fn(val))\nend\n\nlocal shout = function(message)\n  print(message .. '!!')\n    return message\nend\n\nreturn twice(shout, 'hello')\n\nThere are all examples of higher-order functions that accept a function as an argument.\nAnother kind of higher-order function is one that returns another function:\nlocal wrapper = function()\n  return function()\n    return 'You found the treasure!'\n  end\nend\n\nlocal kinder_surprise = wrapper()\nlocal secret = kinder_surprise()\nreturn secret\n\nWhen we ran wrapper it returned us another function that we had to invoke to get to the innermost value.\nTo avoid all the variable names, you can save some time and invoke such kinds of functions like so:\nlocal wrapper = function()\n  return function()\n        return 'You found the treasure!'\n    end\nend\n\nreturn wrapper()()\n\nClosures\nWhich number will print out by running the following code?\nlocal number = 3\n\nlocal closure = function()\n  local number = 5\n  return function()\n    print(number)\n  end\nend\n\n\nlocal print_number = closure()\nprint_number()\n\nStrange?\nOk, so let's try a this same function-returning-a-function thing but passing in some data:\nlocal adder = function(a)\n  return function(b)\n    return a + b\n  end\nend\n\nlocal add_three = adder(3)\n\nreturn add_three(1)\n\nThe add_three variable is assigned a unique and special function.\nIt is assigned the inner function within the adder function, but with the data we passed in now assigned to the a variable.\nEven though the function was returned outside of the scope it was defined in, the scope's data was enclosed inside the returned function until the function was discarded and the program exited.\nThese types of functions are common in situations where a function needs to be generated multiple times but with different data sets.\nThe data in the closure can also continue to be updated, giving you the ability to make storage containers for your data.\nTry this out:\nlocal make_counter = function()\n  local number = 0\n  return function()\n    number = number + 1\n    return number\n  end\nend\n\nlocal count = make_counter()\nprint(count())\nprint(count())\nprint(count())\nprint(count())\n\nIn programs like LÖVE there are callback systems where a similar effect happens:\nlocal entity = require('entity')\n\nlove.draw = function()\n  entity:draw()\nend\n\nAs seen in the previous chapter, the love.draw callback is defined in a main.lua file and later invoked somewhere within the game engine.\nSince love.draw was defined in the scope where the entity variable is defined, the entity variable lives on and can be used inside love.draw long after the main.lua file is done being invoked.\nConclusion\nClosures take some practice to understand and appreciate, but once you see practical examples of where and how to use them they become an indispensable item on your programming toolbelt.\nIn the previous section we used the term composite data to compare primitive and non-primitive data types.\nIn this section we saw how to go about composing higher-order functions.\nIn the following pages we will cover some higher-order functions that are the building blocks for old and modern software alike.\nExercises\n\nIn the make_counter example above, try generating multiple counters:\n-- Do the numbers in each counter stay in\n-- sync or are they tracked independently?\nlocal count_a = make_counter()\nlocal count_b = make_counter()\n\n\nUsing the same make_counter example, modify it to return a table instead of a function. Within this table, define an increment and decrement function so that you can make the counter number go up or down. How would you use such a function?\n\n\n"},"pages/03-03-map-and-filter.html":{"url":"pages/03-03-map-and-filter.html","title":"3.03 - Map and filter","keywords":"","body":"Map and filter\nIn the previous section we practiced creating some higher order functions.\nIn this sections we'll compose two higher-order functions commonly used in internet applications for transforming lists.\nWe'll start by taking a look at our grocery list to see what items we need to pick up:\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  {\n    name = 'grapes',\n    price = '7.20',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'celery',\n    price = '5.50',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'walnuts',\n    price = '6.20',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'sugar',\n    price = '8.00',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'mayonnaise',\n    price = '3.50',\n    location = 'dressings'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'cream',\n    price = '3.00',\n    location = 'dairy'\n  }\n}\n\nThis list has more information than we want to see at a quick glance.\nIf we wanted to only display a numbered list of item names, we could do so by writing a for-loop that generates a new list for us:\nlocal new_grocery_list = {}\nfor key, value in ipairs(grocery_list) do\n  new_grocery_list[key] = key .. '. ' .. value.name\nend\n\nfor _, value in ipairs(new_grocery_list) do\n  print(value)\nend\n\nHere we generated a list with a loop then looped over the list again to print our results:\n1. grapes\n2. celery\n3. walnuts\n4. sugar\n5. mayonnaise\n6. cream\nThis works great for simple code like this example, but it can get messy if you are working with many lists or if you want to transform lists to different formats.\nMap\nHere's our higher order function, map.\nIt takes a list and a function as arguments then returns a new list.\nlocal map = function(list, transform_fn)\n  local new_list = {}\n  for key, value in ipairs(list) do\n    new_list[key] = transform_fn(value, key)\n  end\n  return new_list\nend\n\nA new list is created by looping over each item in the original list, applying your function to the item, then assigning the transformed data to the new list.\nOur code can be re-written to use the map function:\nlocal map = function(list, transform_fn)\n  local new_list = {}\n  for key, value in ipairs(list) do\n    new_list[key] = transform_fn(value, key)\n  end\n  return new_list\nend\n\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  {\n    name = 'grapes',\n    price = '7.20',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'celery',\n    price = '5.50',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'walnuts',\n    price = '6.20',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'sugar',\n    price = '8.00',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'mayonnaise',\n    price = '3.50',\n    location = 'dressings'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'cream',\n    price = '3.00',\n    location = 'dairy'\n  }\n}\n\nlocal new_grocery_list = map(grocery_list, function(item, index)\n  return index .. '. ' .. item.name\nend)\n\nfor _, value in ipairs(new_grocery_list) do\n  print(value)\nend\n\nCalling map(...) we get back the new list then we loop over it again just to print our results out.\nNotice how the second argument we passed into map is just a function with no name.\nFunctions with no names are sometimes called anonymous functions.\nIn some languages they're called lambdas, especially when used inside a higher-order function in a situation like this.\nThe transform function takes in the item and its index and must return back a new result for map to put inside the new function.\nMaybe a few more examples will help out, so what if we want to return another list with just the prices so we can add up how much we need to spend?\nlocal price_list = map(grocery_list, function(item)\n  print(item.price)\n  return item.price\nend)\n\n7.20\n5.50\n6.20\n8.00\n3.50\n3.00\nHere the map function is passed in a transform function with a print statement inside it.\nThat way it will print the item prices as it builds the list so you can see what each value will be.\nIf you had other lists for which you wanted to print prices, it could be done quite easily with map:\nlocal transform_fn = function(item) return item.price end\n\nmap(grocery_list, transform_fn)\nmap(car_parts, transform_fn)\nmap(card_transactions, transform_fn)\n\nFilter\nLet's say we wanted to only see the things on our grocery list that are in the baking aisle.\nWe could write a loop to do that:\nlocal filtered_list = {}\nfor _, value in ipairs(grocery_list) do\n  if value.location == 'baking' then\n    filtered_list[#filtered_list + 1] = value\n  end\nend\n\nfor _, value in ipairs(filtered_list) do\n  print(value.name)\nend\n\nTry running that and once it makes sense, let's think about how to turn this into a re-usable higher-order function like map.\nWe'll make a function called filter that, like map, takes a list and a function.\nThe function will return true if it wants to put an item in the new list or false if it doesn't.\nWe'll call it the predicate function.\nlocal filter = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  local new_list = {}\n  for key, value in ipairs(list) do\n    -- The predicate_fn that was passed in should return\n    -- a value that evaluates to either true or false.\n    if predicate_fn(value, key) then\n      new_list[#new_list + 1] = value\n    end\n  end\n  return new_list\nend\n\nAnd we can use this function to filter down to just our baking items like this:\nlocal filter = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  local new_list = {}\n  for key, value in ipairs(list) do\n    if predicate_fn(value, key) then\n      new_list[#new_list + 1] = value\n    end\n  end\n  return new_list\nend\n\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  {\n    name = 'grapes',\n    price = '7.20',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'celery',\n    price = '5.50',\n    location = 'produce'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'walnuts',\n    price = '6.20',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'sugar',\n    price = '8.00',\n    location = 'baking'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'mayonnaise',\n    price = '3.50',\n    location = 'dressings'\n  },\n  {\n    name = 'cream',\n    price = '3.00',\n    location = 'dairy'\n  }\n}\n\nlocal filtered_list = filter(grocery_list, function(item)\n  return item.location == 'baking'\nend)\n\nfor _, value in ipairs(filtered_list) do\n  print(value.name)\nend\n\nwalnuts\nsugar\nNotice our predicate function we wrote:\nfunction(item)\n  return item.location == 'baking'\nend\n\nThe operation after the return always returns a boolean true or false, so filter knows exactly what to do with the item based on those results.\nYou can imagine the filter function could be useful for processing a search query.\nFor instance, if we wanted to see only medium-sized shirts that fit a specific price range:\nfilter(products, function(item)\n  if item.type == 'shirt' then\n    if item.size == 'M' then\n      return item.price \nCaveats\nThe filter function returns a new list, but the items in the list still reference the old list if they aren't primitives.\nFor instance if we modified the grocery list, the filtered copy would be updated.\nlocal filtered_list = filter(grocery_list, function(item)\n  return item.location == 'baking'\nend)\n\ngrocery_list[3].name = 'peanuts'\nprint(filtered_list[1].name)\n\npeanuts\nThis behavior can be advantageous if it's expected, but it's something that should be understood about how Lua and similar programming languages work.\nThis is explained more in 3.1 - Primitives and references.\nAnother thing to consider is whether or not to write the functions yourself or to use a pre-written library you can require into your project.\nNot all implementations are the same and some may perform better than others, or behave differently.\nSome languages have built-in versions of these functions to standardize things.\nUnfortunately Lua doesn't provide these functions built in or as a standard library.\nAt least you now know how to write them yourself if the need arises.\nExercises\n\nTry filtering the grocery list to only \"produce\" items, then mapping those results down to just the names.\nUsing filter, now can you return the number of items in the grocery list with a price of more than 5? Hint: you will need to use tonumber() to convert the item prices to numbers for comparing.\n\n"},"pages/03-04-stack-and-recursion.html":{"url":"pages/03-04-stack-and-recursion.html","title":"3.04 - Stack and recursion","keywords":"","body":"Stack and recursion\nWhen running a program, the interpreter (Lua in this case) keeps track of variables defined in a scope and which function you are currently in.\nIt organizes this information into a list in memory called the stack.\nThe first item in the stack is the starting point - the root of your application.\nTake the following example:\nlocal two = function()\n  print('two')\nend\n\nlocal one = function()\n  print('one')\n  two()\nend\n\none()\n\nWhen starting the program, the start of the stack is the top level of the module.\nThe Lua stack calls this the \"main chunk\".\nWhen a function is invoked, another layer is added to the stack.\nEvery time a function is called from another function, the stack continues to build.\nSo with the example code above, The stack will follow the progression:\n\nStack is { \"main chunk\" }.\nNow start executing one.

Stack is now { \"main chunk\" }.\nProgram exits.\n\nThis can be visualized by throwing an error at any point the program.\nThe interpreter will give you back a stack trace that details where it was when the problem occurred.\nLua provides a helpful error function for debugging that we can use here:\nlocal three = function()\n  error('This is an error.')\nend\n\nlocal two = function()\n  print('two')\n  three()\nend\n\nlocal one = function()\n  print('one')\n  two()\nend\n\none()\n\nUnfortunately the REPL doesn't provide us with stack traces, but if you have a Lua interpreter on your computer (lua command, luajit, or LÖVE) you will see the error message and a stack trace like this:\nlua: test.lua:2: This is an error.\nstack traceback:\n        [C]: in function 'error'\n        test.lua:2: in upvalue 'three'\n        test.lua:7: in upvalue 'two'\n        test.lua:12: in local 'one'\n        test.lua:15: in main chunk\n        [C]: in ?\nFrom the \"stack traceback\" you can see the newest from the top of the stack to the oldest on the bottom.\nIn complex programs is can be very beneficial to see which function invoked another function to help trace down how an error came about.\nUnderstanding the stack is beneficial for more than just reading errors.\nLet's switch the conversation over to something seemingly unrelated for a bit.\nRecursion\nWhen thinking of loops, many programmers first think of the for loop or the while loop.\nAnother common method is to make a function call itself.\nSimilar to the while loop, you can create infinite loops like this one\nlocal loop\nloop = function()\n  print('hello!')\n  loop()\nend\n\nWhen a function invokes itself, whether directly or indirectly, this is called recursion.\nThe same function will recur again and again until a condition changes.\nOr in the case above, loop() will be called unconditionally.\nWithout a condition, any kind of loop will run infinitely (or crash trying).\nHere's a loop that is a little safer to run:\nlocal count_to_5\ncount_to_5 = function(current_number)\n  print(current_number)\n  if current_number \nWhich prints:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nOne quick little aside;\nNotice how the function was defined in both these situations:\nlocal loop\nloop = function()\n  ...\n\nThe variable was defined before the function was created.\nSince the function needs to access the variable inside itself, the variable needs to exist at the time the function's scope is created.\nVariables created after the function are unknown to the function.\nThis is discussed in 1.17 - Scopes and is a limitation of Lua's design.\nFortunately there is shorthand syntax for writing recursive functions:\nlocal function count_to_5(current_number)\n  print(current_number)\n  if current_number \nis the same as writing:\nlocal count_to_5\ncount_to_5 = function(current_number)\n  ...\n\nLet's try another recursive loop:\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  'pumpkin',\n  'pecans',\n  'butter',\n  'flour',\n  'sugar'\n}\n\nlocal function print_items(list, index)\n  index = index or 1\n  if index \nWhich prints the grocery list.\nDon't forget the local at the beginning of local function print_items, otherwise you will accidentally generate global variables in your code when trying to define functions.\nWe can even re-implement our map function from earlier to use recursion instead of a for loop.\nlocal grocery_list = {\n  'pumpkin',\n  'pecans',\n  'butter',\n  'flour',\n  'sugar'\n}\n\nlocal function map(orig_list, transform_fn, new_list)\n  new_list = new_list or {}\n  if #new_list \nWhich prints:\n1. pumpkin\n2. pecans\n3. butter\n4. flour\n5. sugar\n\nStack overflow\nSo what does the stack look like during recursion when a function enters itself?\nHere's a script to test:\nlocal function recur(n)\n  -- assert is like error, but takes an expression to test. If the\n  -- expression passed becomes false then it throws the error message.\n  assert(n \nlua: test2.lua:2: This is a conditional error\nstack traceback:\n        [C]: in function 'assert'\n        test2.lua:2: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test2.lua:4: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test2.lua:4: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test2.lua:4: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test2.lua:4: in local 'recur'\n        test2.lua:7: in main chunk\n        [C]: in ?\nEvery time the function recurs we get another addition to the stack.\nThis can be a problem if you are looping over a large set of data because the stack will consume more and more memory as it stacks up.\nThis can be accomplished by creating a recursive loop that runs infinitely.\nIf you haven't tried so already, here's an easy example:\nlocal function recur()\n  recur()\nend\n\nrecur()\n\nWhen the stack reaches a critical size, you get a stack overflow error:\nlua: test3.lua:2: stack overflow\nstack traceback:\n        test3.lua:2: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test3.lua:2: in upvalue 'recur'\n        ...\n        test3.lua:2: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test3.lua:2: in upvalue 'recur'\n        test3.lua:2: in local 'recur'\n        test3.lua:5: in main chunk\n        [C]: in ?\n\nWith a specific return statement added to the loop, however, we no longer get a stack overflow:\nlocal function recur()\n  return recur()\nend\n\nrecur()\n\nThis will run until you manually kill the application process.\nKilling it returns a somewhat mysterious stack track:\nlua: test4.lua:2: interrupted!\nstack traceback:\n        test4.lua:2: in function \n        (...tail calls...)\n        test4.lua:2: in function \n        (...tail calls...)\n        test4.lua:5: in main chunk\n        [C]: in ?\nSo how did our modification save us from overflowing our stack?\nTail call optimization\nInside a function when you return another function call, the interpreter has the ability to re-use the same layer of the stack instead of creating another layer.\nThis works with direct recursion (function calling itself) and indirect (mutual) recursion such as two functions calling each other:\nlocal one\nlocal two\n\none = function()\n  return two()\nend\n\ntwo = function()\n  return one()\nend\n\none()\n\nProgramming in Lua goes into greater detail on when a recursion will or won't be optimized, but the simple thing to remember is that the function(s) must return the value of invoking a function for this to work.\nThe following will be tail-call optimized:\nlocal one\nlocal two\n\none = function(n)\n  print(n)\n  return two(n + 1)\nend\n\ntwo = function(n)\n  print(n)\n  return one(n + 1)\nend\n\n-- Count until we run out of numbers\none(1)\n\nBut the following won't, since it returns an operation including the function call instead of just the function call itself:\nlocal one\nlocal two\n\none = function(n)\n  print(n)\n  return 1 + two(n)\nend\n\ntwo = function(n)\n  print(n)\n  return 1 + one(n)\nend\n\n-- This won't work!\none(1)\n\nThe case for recursive loops\nSo why would we want to do recursion?\nIt seems trickier than a for loop and perhaps just as easy to mess up as a while loop.\nIt's not necessarily a replacement for the for loop, but allows you to do certain things you can't easily do without recursion.\nTake this example from Rosetta Code which will flatten a list of lists into a single, flat list.\nIt uses a for loop and a recursive loop in conjunction with each other:\nlocal function flatten(list)\n  if type(list) ~= \"table\" then return {list} end\n  local flat_list = {}\n  for _, elem in ipairs(list) do\n    for _, val in ipairs(flatten(elem)) do\n      flat_list[#flat_list + 1] = val\n    end\n  end\n  return flat_list\nend\n\nlocal test_list = {\n  {1},\n  2,\n  {{3,4}, 5},\n  {{{}}},\n  {{{6}}},\n  7,\n  8,\n  {}\n}\n\nprint(table.concat(flatten(test_list), \",\"))\n\nWhich prints:\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nThis function isn't tail-call optimized, but it probably won't be passed a nested list deep enough to cause a stack overflow.\nHere's just a few of the many situations where recursion is usually the best tool for the job:\n\nSorting data\nSearching trees (nested data) in a database or nested folders in a filesystem.\nFinding the shortest path between two points\nLoops that increment or decrement in irregular patterns\nEvaluating a finite set of moves in a game like chess\n\nThe point isn't to replace the for loop, although you can.\nTake the following example, which returns the factorial of the given number (5):\nlocal fact = function(n)\n  local acc = 1\n  for iteration = n, 1, -1 do\n    acc = acc * iteration\n  end\n  return acc\nend\n\nprint(fact(5))\n\nThe same functionality written with a recursive loop would look very different:\nlocal function fact(n, acc)\n  acc = acc or 1\n  if n == 0 then\n    return acc\n  end\n  return fact(n-1, n*acc)\nend\n\n...but one method wouldn't offer an advantage over the other here.\nDepending on the language you are working in, one method may be easier to read than the other.\nMaybe the language supports one type of loop and not the other.\nThese are the factors that will often do the deciding for you.\n"},"pages/03-05-reduce.html":{"url":"pages/03-05-reduce.html","title":"3.05 - Reduce","keywords":"","body":"Reduce (fold)\nIn previous sections we discussed many methods for iterating over data and transforming it.\nIn this section we'll discuss another higher order function that is arguably one of the most powerful.\nIt is a concept recognized across enough programming languages to get its own wikipedia article.\nMost popular languages call it reduce, although some languages will call it fold or inject.\nHere's the parameters it takes, and although the order of the parameters may be different in other languages the functionality and output will be the same.\nreduce(list, fn, starting_value)\nLike with map() and filter(), it takes a list you want to transform and a function (fn) to do the transformation.\nThe transformation function behaves like a recursive loop like seen in the last section.\nHere's a function that takes a list of numbers and gives you the total sum of those numbers.\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n\nlocal sum_fn = function(accumulator, current_number)\n  return accumulator + current_number\nend\n\n\nlocal total_sum = reduce(list, sum_fn, 0)\n\nWe pass reduce a starting number of 0.\nWhat happens is sum_fn is invoked with the first parameter, the accumulator being the starting number 0 and current_number being the first number in the list.\nWhatever value the function returns becomes the new value for accumulator next loop around.\nLua doesn't have a reduce function built in so we'll implement our own here with a detailed description of all the parameters.\nTry not to get too hung up on the actual reduce function's implementation at the top, but rather focus below that on how it works.\nThere will be several more examples.\nOnce you understand how to use it, go back to the top and look at the actual reduce function's implementation.\nCopy all this code into the text editor window on the REPL and run it:\n-- Applies fn on two arguments cumulative to the items of the array t,\n-- from left to right, so as to reduce the array to a single value. If\n-- a first value is specified the accumulator is initialized to this,\n-- otherwise the first value in the array is used.\n-- @param {table} t - a table to reduce\n-- @param {function} fn - the reducer for comparing the two values\n--   @param {*} acc - The accumulator accumulates the callback's return\n--     values; It is the accumulated value previously returned in the\n--     last invocation of the callback, or `first_value`, if supplied.\n--   @param {*} current_value - The current element being processed in the list.\n--   @param {number} current_index - The index of the current element\n--     being processed in the list, starting at 1.\n-- @param {*} first_value - The initial value of the accumulation. If the array is\n--   empty, the first_value will also be the returned value. If the array is empty\n--   and no first value is specified an error is raised.\n-- @example\n--   -- returns 'zxy'\n--   reduce(\n--     { 'x', 'y' },\n--     function(a, b) return a + b end,\n--     'z'\n--    )\nlocal function reduce(t, fn, first)\n  local acc = first\n  local starting_value = first ~= nil\n  for i, v in ipairs(t) do\n    -- No starting value, start on\n    -- the first element in the list\n    if starting_value then\n      acc = fn(acc, v, i, t)\n    else\n      acc = v\n      starting_value = true\n    end\n  end\n  assert(\n    starting_value,\n    'Attempted to reduce an empty table with no first value.'\n  )\n  return acc\nend\n\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\nlocal sum_fn = function(accumulator, current_number)\n  print(accumulator)\n  return accumulator + current_number\nend\n\nlocal total_sum = reduce(list, sum_fn, 0)\nprint('The total sum is:', total_sum)\n\nFollowing the print statement inside of sum_fn, we can see that the accumulator starts out with the 0 we pass in.\nWe add current_number to accumulator and it begins to accumulate all the values as it goes.\n0\n23\n86\n98\n146\nThe total sum is:   149\nIf we don't pass in a starting number, the accumulator will begin right away with the first number in the list:\nlocal sum_fn = function(accumulator, current_number)\n  print(accumulator)\n  return accumulator + current_number\nend\n\nlocal total_sum = reduce(list, sum_fn)\n\n23\n86\n98\n146\nThe total sum is:   149\nIf you've used javascript, you may be starting to see the uncanny resemblance it bears to javascript's reduce function.\nBoth languages are very similar syntactically, and given the ubiquity of javascript this Lua implementation follows much of the same behavior.\nLet's look at some more examples to better understand how to reduce and what situations doing so could prove useful.\nThe reduce function is omitted in the following examples, but you can copy and paste the function in the REPL alongside the examples to run the code yourself.\n-- Concatenate a list of words\nlocal list = {'this', 'is', 'a', 'sentence'}\n\nlocal sentence = reduce(list, function(acc, word, index, list)\n  -- Add a period if this is the last word\n  if index == #list then\n    word = word .. '.'\n  end\n  -- Otherwise add a space between the words\n  return acc .. ' ' .. word\nend)\n\nprint(sentence)\n\nthis is a sentence.\n-- Only keep odd numbers\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\nlocal odd_numbers = reduce(list, function(acc, current_number)\n  if current_number % 2 == 0 then\n    return acc\n  end\n  acc[#acc + 1] = current_number\n  return acc\nend, {})\n\nfor key, value in ipairs(odd_numbers) do\n  print(value)\nend\n\n23\n63\n3\nThis looks similar to what we might do with the filter function previously covered in 3.3 - Map and filter.\nIn fact, we can compose filter and map from reduce.\nTake a look at the same code refactored out:\nlocal filter = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  return reduce(list, function(acc, val, i, t)\n    if predicate_fn(val, i, t) then\n      acc[#acc + 1] = val\n      return acc\n    end\n    return acc\n  end, {})\nend\n\n\n-- Only keep odd numbers\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\nlocal odd_numbers = filter(list, function(current_number)\n  return current_number % 2 ~= 0\nend)\n\nfor key, value in ipairs(odd_numbers) do\n  print(value)\nend\n\nAn example of wrapping reduce with a new map function won't be explained here, but rather left up to the reader as an exercise at the end of this section.\nHere's one more example that is a bit more complex, a function called compose that creates a pipeline for passing data through.\nIt accomplishes this by passing any functions you give it through to reduce as a list:\n-- Function that allows you to compose other functions\n-- together to form a pipeline. The resulting pipeline\n-- is a function that you can pass your intended data through.\nlocal compose = function(...)\n  -- \"...\" and \"arg\" are special keywords in Lua.\n  -- See: https://www.lua.org/pil/5.2.html\n  local fns = arg\n  return function(x)\n    return reduce(fns, function(acc, v)\n      return v(acc)\n    end, x)\n  end\nend\n\n-- Some example composable functions\nlocal add = function(x)\n  return function(y)\n    return y + x\n  end\nend\nlocal multiply = function(x)\n  return function(y)\n    return y * x\n  end\nend\nlocal subtract = function(x)\n  return function(y)\n    return y - x\n  end\nend\n\n\nlocal number_pipeline = compose(add(12), multiply(2), subtract(9))\nprint(number_pipeline(3))\nprint(number_pipeline(2))\n\nAlternative reduce implementations\nIterating tables\nLet's go back to the implementation of reduce for a moment.\nTake a look at the implementation of it given above.\nNotice the iteration inside is using ipairs which expects an array/list-type table.\nIf we wanted to reduce a non-list table we could modify reduce to first check if the table is an array and do appropriate iteration over the table whether or not it is.\nLet's test that:\nlocal function reduce(t, fn, first)\n  local get_iterator = function(t)\n    if type(t) == 'table' then\n      -- If property of 1 is empty then\n      -- iterate as a regular keyed table\n      if t[1] == nil then\n        return pairs(t)\n      end\n      return ipairs(t)\n    end\n    error('Expected table, got ' .. tostring(t))\n  end\n  local acc = first\n  local starting_value = first ~= nil\n  -- Whether we do ipairs or pairs is conditional\n  for i, v in get_iterator(t) do\n    -- No starting value, start on\n    -- the first element in the list\n    if starting_value then\n      acc = fn(acc, v, i, t)\n    else\n      acc = v\n      starting_value = true\n    end\n  end\n  assert(\n    starting_value,\n    'Attempted to reduce an empty table with no first value.'\n  )\n  return acc\nend\n\n\nlocal list = {\n  monday = 23,\n  tuesday = 63,\n  wednesday = 12,\n  thursday = 48,\n  friday = 3\n}\nlocal total_sum = reduce(list, function(acc, current_number, key)\n  print(key .. ': ' .. current_number)\n  return acc + current_number\nend)\n\nprint('total sum: ' .. total_sum)\n\nThis should print something like this:\nwednesday: 12\nfriday: 3\nthursday: 48\nmonday: 23\ntotal sum: 149\nNote that the order the keys are iterated in are not guaranteed.\nAlso \"tuesday\" wasn't printed out because it was the starting number, but it was still included in the total.\nPassing an extra argument of 0 to reduce would have caused all the days to be passed through our reducer function and printed out.\nBreak early\nOk, here's another example that seems tricky at first glance;\nLet's say you implemented some search functionality on top of reduce like this:\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n\nlocal find = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  return reduce(list, function(acc, v, i, t)\n    if predicate_fn(v, a, t) then\n      return v\n    end\n    return acc\n  end)\nend\n\nprint(find(list, function(val)\n  return val > 50\nend))\nprint(find(list, function(val)\n  return val % 8 == 0\nend))\n\nWhich prints out the expected results:\n63\n48\nBut do you see what's problematic about this?\nIf we find the results we want, the reduce function will keep running through the entire list unnecessarily.\nTypically when doing a search you only want the first item you find anyway, but the above implementation will return the last item found if more than one match is made.\nDo you remember how the reduce function passes in the table as the last argument to the reducer function?\nWe can take control of iterator via the table and kill the iteration prematurely.\nThis involved mutating the table:\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n\nlocal find = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  return reduce(list, function(acc, v, i, t)\n    if predicate_fn(v, a, t) then\n      -- If a result was found, destroy the next item in the list\n      -- to prevent the iteration from going any further.\n      t[i + 1] = nil\n      return v\n    end\n    return acc\n  end)\nend\n\nprint(find(list, function(val)\n  return val > 1\nend))\n\nThis returns the correct result:\n23\nBut if we loop over the table afterwards we can see we've messed with the original data which can lead to unexpected consequences in a real application.\nIf your data is coming from an immutable source, meaning something is generating a new copy each time you use it then this wouldn't be a problem:\nlocal generate_list = function()\n  return {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\nend\n\nreduce(generate_list(), function()\n  ...\n  ...\n\nHowever we could fix all of this if we are willing to add another parameter to our reduce implementation.\nlocal function reduce(t, fn, first)\n  local get_iterator = function(t)\n    if type(t) == 'table' then\n      -- If property of 1 is empty then\n      -- iterate as a regular keyed table\n      if t[1] == nil then\n        return pairs(t)\n      end\n      return ipairs(t)\n    end\n    error('Expected table, got ' .. tostring(t))\n  end\n  local acc = first\n  local starting_value = first ~= nil\n  for i, v in get_iterator(t) do\n    -- Exit the loop when true\n    local should_break = false\n    -- No starting value, start on\n    -- the first element in the list\n    if starting_value then\n      acc, should_break = fn(acc, v, i, t)\n      if should_break then\n        break\n      end\n    else\n      acc = v\n      starting_value = true\n    end\n  end\n  assert(\n    starting_value,\n    'Attempted to reduce an empty table with no first value.'\n  )\n  return acc\nend\n\nNow if we pass true as a second return parameter then we will get the first number we are looking for instead of the last.\nLoop through and print out the list afterward to make sure we haven't mutated it unexpectedly.\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n\nlocal find = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  return reduce(list, function(acc, v, i, t)\n    if predicate_fn(v, a, t) then\n      return v, true\n    end\n    return acc\n  end, false)\nend\n\nprint(find(list, function(val)\n  return val > 1\nend))\n\nfor idx, val in ipairs(list) do\n  print(idx, val)\nend\n\nreduce_right\nAnother possible change you would want to make is to replace the iterator with a custom-made one to transform data in a specific order or pattern.\nTaken from lua-users.org's Iteration Tutorial is this reverse-ipairs (ripairs) implementation that allows you to iterate over a table from right to left.\nThis modified version of reduce is typically called reduce_right.\nlocal function reduce_right(t, fn, first)\n  local ripairs = function(t)\n    local max = 1\n    while t[max] ~= nil do\n      max = max + 1\n    end\n    local function ripairs_it(t, i)\n      i = i-1\n      local v = t[i]\n      if v ~= nil then\n        return i,v\n      else\n        return nil\n      end\n    end\n    return ripairs_it, t, max\n  end\n  local acc = first\n  local starting_value = first ~= nil\n  for i, v in ripairs(t) do\n    -- Exit the loop when true\n    local should_break = false\n    -- No starting value, start on\n    -- the first element in the list\n    if starting_value then\n      acc, should_break = fn(acc, v, i, t)\n      if should_break then\n        break\n      end\n    else\n      acc = v\n      starting_value = true\n    end\n  end\n  assert(\n    starting_value,\n    'Attempted to reduce an empty table with no first value.'\n  )\n  return acc\nend\n\nThen swap out reduce for reduce_right in the places you want to use it:\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n\nlocal find = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  return reduce_right(list, function(acc, v, i, t)\n    if predicate_fn(v, a, t) then\n      return v, true\n    end\n    return acc\n  end, false)\nend\n\nprint(find(list, function(val)\n  return val > 1\nend))\n\nRecursive\nSince we talked about recursion in the last section, let's try a recursive implementation of reduce.\nAlthough with Lua there's no practical reason to choose a recursive implementation over a for-loop or while-loop implementation, doing recursion is fun.\nlocal function reduce(t, fn, acc, key)\n  -- Check for starting value\n  if key == nil and acc == nil then\n    key = next(t, key)\n    acc = t[key]\n  end\n  -- Begin next iteration. Next is a Lua built-in function\n  -- that fetches the next key in a table after the given key.\n  -- See: https://www.lua.org/pil/7.3.html\n  key = next(t, key)\n  -- Return acc if we've iterated all keys\n  if key == nil then\n    return acc\n  end\n  local break_early = false\n  -- Collect new accumulator from predicate function\n  acc, break_early = fn(acc, t[key], key, t)\n  -- Check to see if the predicate wants to end early\n  if break_early then\n    return acc\n  end\n  -- Recur\n  return reduce(t, fn, acc, key, acc)\nend\n\n\n-- Test it by getting the total sum from a table like before\nlocal list = {\n  monday = 23,\n  tuesday = 63,\n  wednesday = 12,\n  thursday = 48,\n  friday = 3\n}\nlocal total_sum = reduce(list, function(acc, current_number, key)\n  print(key .. ': ' .. current_number)\n  return acc + current_number\nend, 0)\n\nprint('total sum: ' .. total_sum)\n\nThis supports breaking early like the two previous implementations.\nExercises\n\nCreate a count function that counts up the number of items in a list that match the predicate and returns the total. It should work like this:\nlocal count = function(list, predicate_fn)\n  ????\nend\n\nlocal list = {23, 63, 12, 48, 3}\n-- Print number of items evenly divisible by 3 (should return 4)\nprint(count(list, function(v)\n  return v % 3 == 0\nend))\n\n\nGo back to the map section in 3.3 and see if you can reimplement the map function on top of reduce.\n\n\n"}}}
