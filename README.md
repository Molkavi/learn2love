## What is this book?

This is a resource for building a programming foundation from scratch.
It teaches basic computer science and software building skills along the way, but more importantly, teaches you how to teach yourself and find out how to go about solving a problem or building a solution.
Tools come and go, so the goal is to teach things of value with less focus on the programming language or other tools you may be using to build what you want.
I have been programming since 2007, focusing on teaching myself best practices. Along the way I have found a lot of good and bad tutorials on the right and wrong way to build things and I want to help others avoid getting stuck like I did.

## Who is this for?

- **Any age group.** Kids too, with a little help and encouragement!
- **Anybody that wants to learn basic computer science.** This book will touch on several computer science subjects in order to build programs.
- **Anybody that wants to learn to program.** No prior skills or knowledge required.
- **Anybody that wants to learn to make a game.** Making games are fun and require learning many things along the way. We'll build a few through this book.
- **Anybody that wants to learn Lua.** Although we won't dive into the advanced features of the language, we will gain a large understanding on how the language works in order to actually build some things. There are already online guides and references covering some of the more advanced topics. For experienced programmers wanting to learn Lua, the [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) book may be sufficient.
